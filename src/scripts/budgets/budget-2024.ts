  summary:
    "Budget 2024 tackles housing supply head-on by unlocking public land, tying infrastructure dollars to zoning reform, speeding approvals, and expanding low-cost financing to drive millions of new homes by 2031.\n- It leans into productivity and competitiveness with large, targeted bets on AI compute, SR&ED modernization, clean electricity and manufacturing tax credits, EV supply chains, and faster major-project approvals.\n- It adds social supports (Canada Disability Benefit, pharmacare phase 1, dental, school food) while capping junk fees, returning the small-business carbon rebate, and easing student costs.\n- To fund this, it tightens tax fairness (higher capital-gains inclusion above $250k, with a new entrepreneurs' incentive), keeps deficits trending down (<1% of GDP after 2026–27), and targets a declining debt-to-GDP.",

  rationale:
    'On balance, the bill advances housing supply, productivity, and investment at meaningful scale while keeping debt and deficits on a credible glidepath—key ingredients for broad-based prosperity. The main caution is that capital-gains changes could blunt risk-taking unless carefully implemented alongside pro-entrepreneur offsets.\n\n- Strong alignment: housing supply unlocks; permitting/"one project, one review"; AI/compute and SR&ED modernization; clean-growth ITCs; trade/transport upgrades; Indigenous capital access.\n- Weak spots: capital-gains hike may deter founders and investment; extensive new programs risk higher admin costs without hard efficiency targets.\n- Recommendations for Builders: broaden and simplify the entrepreneurs\' incentive (founder-share deferrals, wider eligibility); publish a national housing scoreboard with monthly starts vs. targets and enforceable consequences; legislate firm permitting timelines with automatic approvals after deadline; hard cap admin overhead for new benefits; accelerate code harmonization and factory-built housing certification; tie more infrastructure dollars to export-enabling projects; keep deficits under 1% of GDP and debt on a declining path with mid-year fiscal checkpoints.',
