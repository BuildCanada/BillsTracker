C-12,An Act respecting certain measures relating to the security of Canada's borders and the integrity of the Canadian immigration system and respecting other related security measures,7,-0.04,low,"Affected sectors: (1) Financial services and payments (banks, credit unions, insurers, securities dealers, PSPs under the RPAA, MSBs, crypto asset dealers), real estate brokerages, casinos, dealers in precious metals and stones, accountants/notaries — collectively 15,000–20,000 reporting entities; (2) Exporters/logistics (port/airport authorities, bonded/sufferance warehouses, carriers); (3) Immigration‑reliant sectors (post‑secondary institutions, tech, hospitality, agriculture). Mechanisms: (a) PCMLTFA changes mandate enrolment of all reporting entities with FINTRAC, explicit requirements for risk‑based/effective AML programs, new compliance orders and very large penalties (up to $30M or 3% of global revenue), expanded inspections/recordkeeping for import/export goods, and more information‑sharing with OSFI; businesses respond by hiring staff, upgrading systems, and de‑risking high‑risk customers; (b) Customs Act changes require owners/operators to provide CBSA facilities free of charge and grant CBSA access to export‑bound goods at warehouses/transport premises; (c) IRPA changes add ineligibility grounds and process tools and create Order‑in‑Council powers to pause or terminate intake/processing and cancel or vary documents — introducing policy uncertainty for international students/workers, while information‑sharing may shorten screening and reduce fraud. Scale (conservative): Incremental AML compliance spend of roughly $200M/year (e.g., Big 6 banks + large FI: ~+$80M; ~200 other regulated FIs at ~$0.5M each: ~$100M; ~14,000 smaller entities at ~$5–10k each: ~$20–40M). CBSA facility/access obligations impose about $30M/year on ports, airports, and warehouses. Immigration policy uncertainty (occasional pauses/targeted orders) assumed at an expected-value cost of ~$25M/year. Offsetting positives: faster IRCC/agency screening and reduced backlogs, plus lower fraud, add roughly $100M/year in earlier labour market entry/administrative efficiency; strengthened AML regime reduces de‑risking/greylisting risk and improves financial integrity by an estimated $30M/year expected value; precursor/drug enforcement changes yield productivity/health gains of ~$20M/year. Net: (-$200M - $30M - $25M) + ($100M + $30M + $20M) ≈ -$105M/year. Over 10 years, ≈ -$1.05B, which is about -0.039% of current GDP ($2.7T). Time horizon: AML/Customs impacts begin within 1–2 years as regulations and enforcement mature; immigration process efficiencies unfold over 2–5 years; OIC powers are enabling and assumed used sparingly. Confidence: low, because many outcomes depend on future regulations and the discretionary use of Order‑in‑Council powers; aggressive use of intake suspensions could move impacts toward -0.2% or worse, while minimal use would reduce the net drag.","Directly relevant to entrepreneurs in finance/fintech/real estate/payments (higher AML obligations and penalties), to exporters/logistics operators (CBSA facility and access requirements), and to firms and institutions reliant on international talent and students (new immigration tools introduce policy uncertainty but may also speed screening). Not a broad economy‑wide tax or competition reform, hence a 7 rather than higher.","Expands and hardens AML/ATF compliance (mandatory FINTRAC enrolment, compliance orders, very large penalties), pushing thousands of reporting entities to increase ongoing compliance spending.",Phased: several provisions on Royal Assent; most AML/FINTRAC and Customs changes within 12–24 months via regulations; immigration process and ineligibility changes and any OIC use materialize over 2–5 years; full steady-state effects by year 5.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-248,An Act respecting the holding of a pan-Canadian conference on time change,3,0.0003,low,"Affected sectors: economy-wide but only tangentially (transportation/logistics, healthcare/public safety, and general business operations via scheduling). Mechanism: the bill only mandates a one-time intergovernmental conference and a public report on time change; this can slightly raise the probability that provinces harmonize time-change policy (e.g., eliminating biannual clock changes or adopting a uniform approach). Scale: Direct one-time spending to host and staff the conference/report is likely $2–5M federally plus ~$1–3M in provincial participation costs (~$3–8M total), equal to ~0.0001%–0.0003% of GDP in the year it occurs. Indirect expected value: If pan-Canadian harmonization were eventually adopted, literature suggests small annual benefits from fewer post-transition accidents/health incidents and minor productivity/scheduling gains on the order of $20–60M per year nationally (~0.0007%–0.0022% of GDP). Assuming a conservative $30M/year benefit that would realistically start a few years after consensus (say 7 years of benefits within the 10-year window), the 10-year gross benefit if adopted is ~$210M. The conference plausibly increases the probability of such harmonization by a modest 3% absolute (from, say, existing efforts) due to information-sharing and coordination. Expected indirect benefit: 0.03 × $210M ≈ $6.3M (~0.00023% of GDP). Adding the direct one-time spending (~$3–5M) yields a total expected 10-year GDP effect around $9–11M, or ~0.0003% of GDP. Time horizon: direct spending within 1–2 years; any indirect benefits would only materialize in 2–5+ years if provinces act. Confidence: low, because the bill itself does not change time policy and any economic gains depend on separate provincial decisions.","This bill is largely administrative (a conference and a report) and does not change time policy or regulations. While time harmonization could marginally reduce scheduling frictions and accident/health costs that affect businesses, the bill itself imposes no new rules and has uncertain, indirect effects for entrepreneurs. Hence low direct relevance.",Convenes an intergovernmental conference and publishes recommendations that slightly increase the likelihood of harmonized time-change policy in the future.,Conference within 12 months; report within 18 months of coming into force; any substantive policy changes would require separate provincial/federal actions over 2–5+ years (more realistically 5–10 years).,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-247,An Act to amend the Canada Labour Code,5,-0.02,low,"Affected sectors: federally regulated industries (ports/marine and rail transport, air transport, telecommunications, banking/couriers/Canada Post, interprovincial pipelines/grain). These sectors together account for roughly 10–15% of GDP, but only a subset is prone to disruptive work stoppages (notably ports/rail/air and telecom). Mechanism: repealing CLC s.107 removes the Minister of Labour’s power to refer questions to the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) or direct the Board to take measures that promote settlement. This modestly reduces the federal government’s ability to expedite Board action on time-sensitive issues (e.g., maintenance of activities orders, unlawful work stoppage rulings, picketing limits), which can lengthen or increase uncertainty around strikes/lockouts. Scale: Over a decade, Canada typically experiences several major federally regulated work stoppages (e.g., ports/rail/postal) plus many smaller ones. Conservatively assume 5 major events over 10 years with an average GDP loss of ~$0.5B per event (combined direct output loss and spillovers that are not fully recouped), for a baseline of ~$2.5B. Without s.107, assume resolution/containment is 10% slower/more protracted in these events due to fewer or slower Minister-initiated referrals/directions to the CIRB, yielding ~$250M incremental loss. Add ~$250M across numerous smaller disputes from slightly slower intervention (e.g., delayed maintenance-of-activities decisions), for a total incremental 10‑year loss of ~$0.5B. As a share of ~$2.7T GDP, that is ~0.019% (rounded to -0.02%). Time horizon: impacts are episodic and occur only during future disputes; most effects materialize immediately to 2–5 years as disputes arise. Guardrails: FMCS conciliation/mediation services, party-initiated CIRB applications, CIRB’s own powers, and potential back‑to‑work legislation remain available, keeping expected economy-wide effects small. Given uncertainty about how often s.107 is used in practice and the variability of large disputes, confidence is low.","Somewhat relevant to builders and entrepreneurs via supply-chain reliability and telecom continuity, especially for trade-exposed or logistics-dependent firms. However, it is a narrow procedural change affecting federal labour-dispute management, with no direct compliance or tax/regulatory changes for most businesses and a small expected macro impact.","Removes the Minister of Labour’s authority to refer matters to or direct the CIRB to act during industrial disputes, modestly increasing the expected duration/uncertainty of strikes/lockouts in federally regulated sectors.",Immediate upon Royal Assent; practical effects occur sporadically during future industrial disputes over the next 10 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
S-237,An Act respecting a Cities and Municipalities Day,2,0.0001,high,"The bill only designates October 31 as “Cities and Municipalities Day” and explicitly states it is not a legal holiday. No taxes, transfers, regulations, or mandated spending are created. The only plausible economic effect is minor voluntary municipal and association outreach/events spending. Conservative estimate: 200 of Canada’s ~3,500 municipalities (≈6%) undertake new, small activities averaging $2,500 each per year, with only 50% being net-new (the rest reallocated or already occurring due to UN World Cities Day), yielding ~$250,000/year in incremental activity. Over 10 years this is ~$2.5 million. Relative to ~$2.7 trillion GDP, this is ~0.000093%, rounded to 0.0001%. No productivity loss occurs since it is not a holiday. Even if participation doubled, the impact would remain <0.0002%.","Primarily ceremonial. It does not change regulations, funding, or business operations. At most, it may create minor marketing or event opportunities for local vendors, but with negligible, indirect effects for builders and entrepreneurs.","Symbolic designation that may prompt small, voluntary municipal outreach/events and communications spending",Immediate upon enactment; recurring annually,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
S-236,An Act to amend the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights and to establish a framework for implementing the rights of victims of crime,3,0.004,low,"Affected sectors: federal justice/public administration (RCMP federal units, Correctional Service Canada, Parole Board, PPSC), legal and social services providers, training/IT vendors; indirect effects on labour productivity of victims. Mechanism: the bill converts several rights from “on request” to proactive notification (sections 6–8), creates a right to access support services, adds assistance to enforce restitution orders (s.17.1), mandates recurring training for federal justice personnel, and requires a national implementation framework and awareness campaign. These provisions drive modest new federal operating and procurement spending and small productivity gains for victims who receive timely services. Scale (conservative): (1) Training for ~20,000 federal justice employees, 3 hours per cycle at ~$80/hour, initial + 3 refreshers over 10 years ≈ $19.2M; course development/updates ≈ $3M. (2) Proactive notification enablement (IT changes and process updates) one-time ≈ $10M; incremental staffing time over 10 years ≈ $8M. (3) Incremental federal victims services support/restorative justice/restitution assistance ≈ $4M/year on average over 10 years ≈ $40M (bill does not appropriate funds; assumes modest ramp within federal jurisdiction only). (4) Awareness campaign and framework development/reporting ≈ $13M. Direct spending subtotal ≈ $90–120M. Indirect effects: modest regained work time/productivity from improved support and information (~$15–25M over 10 years) and small recidivism-related efficiency gains (~$2–5M). Total 10‑year GDP effect ≈ $110–150M. As a share of one year’s GDP ($2.7T), this is ~0.004–0.006% cumulative; we report 0.004% to remain conservative. Time horizon: training within 6–12 months; framework within 1 year; operational/process and small productivity effects materialize over 2–5 years. Confidence: low, because major elements rely on provincial cooperation and separate budget decisions; many benefits are contingent and could be smaller than assumed.","Primarily a justice/victim-rights bill with limited direct business impact. Some indirect opportunities for entrepreneurs in training delivery, IT system updates, legal and social service contracting, and public awareness campaigns, but no broad changes to taxes, permits, or core business regulation. Hence low relevance for most builders/entrepreneurs.","Mandates proactive victim notification, recurring training for federal justice personnel, and assistance with restitution enforcement, creating modest new government spending and small productivity gains for victims.",1-3 years for federal training and framework; 2-5 years for indirect effects; depends on provincial cooperation and funding.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-11,An Act to amend the National Defence Act and other Acts,3,0.002,low,"Affected sectors: Department of National Defence/Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), military police and justice system, RCMP/provincial police and Crown prosecutors/courts, victim services, and limited IT changes to the SOIRA database. Mechanism: (1) Shifts investigations (and, in practice, most prosecutions) of sexual offences committed in Canada by/against CAF members from the military to civilian authorities (ss. 70(d)-(h), 70.1–70.3), requiring transfer of ongoing files within 60 days; (2) creates/expands governance and oversight roles (Provost Marshal General reconstitution, annual reporting, inquiry processes) and introduces victim liaison officer support; (3) harmonizes SOIRA processes, including exemption/variation routes and database removals. Scale: CAF-related sexual offence files are on the order of low hundreds per year; incremental net costs are small because the Government has already been administratively referring these cases to civilian systems in recent years (this bill largely codifies and standardizes that practice). Conservative costing: incremental civilian policing/prosecution overhead beyond current practice ~ $1–3M/year; victim liaison/related supports ~ $2–4M/year; governance/reporting/inquiry readiness ~ $0.5–1M/year; one-time training/IT/forms changes ~ $5–10M. Partial offsets from reduced military police/prosecution workload likely reclaim staff time rather than reduce aggregate spending. Net 10‑year incremental public outlays ≈ $50–70M, which is roughly 0.002% of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP cumulatively. Time horizon: core caseload shift begins 60 days after Royal Assent; full administrative effects phase in over 1–3 years as orders-in-council take effect. Confidence: low, because precise caseload/cost allocation between federal and provincial systems and operational offsets within DND are uncertain, but the direction (negligible macro impact) is robust.","Primarily a military justice and governance bill. It has limited direct implications for builders and entrepreneurs beyond niche opportunities (legal services, training, and small IT work related to SOIRA/justice procedures). No broad changes to taxes, business regulation, procurement volumes, or competitiveness. Hence low relevance to most businesses.","Transfers sexual‑offence investigations in Canada involving CAF members to civilian authorities and adds victim liaison/oversight roles, causing small, mainly administrative public‑sector cost shifts and one‑time training/IT updates.",Core transfer provisions take effect 60 days after Royal Assent; remaining governance/SOIRA changes roll out by order in council over ~1–3 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-10,An Act respecting the Commissioner for Modern Treaty Implementation,6,0.01,low,"Affected sectors: resource extraction (mining, energy, forestry) and related logistics in modern treaty regions; construction/infrastructure on treaty lands; professional services tied to consultation/impact assessment; federal procurement with Indigenous governments. Mechanism: the bill creates an independent Commissioner and Office to conduct performance audits and publish recommendations on federal modern treaty implementation. This can (a) reduce approval and funding delays caused by inconsistent federal compliance, (b) lower the incidence/duration of implementation disputes and litigation that stall projects, and (c) improve interdepartmental coordination so treaty-related transfers and approvals are processed more predictably. Scale assumptions: economic activity that is meaningfully sensitive to federal modern treaty implementation steps is conservatively assumed at $3–5B per year (subset of territorial/northern projects and treaty-governed areas in BC/QC/Labrador). A modest process/coordination improvement of 0.3–0.6% realized gradually yields ~$10–30M/year in additional/accelerated output. Add avoided disruption/litigation valued at ~$15–25M/year and administrative efficiency savings of ~$5M/year across departments and treaty partners. Gross benefits: ~$30–60M/year once the office is established and practices diffuse; 10-year cumulative gross impact ~$300–600M. Office operating costs likely ~$15–20M/year (comparable oversight bodies), or ~$150–200M over 10 years. Net 10-year impact: ~$150–450M. Relative to a ~$2.7T GDP, that is ~0.006–0.017%. Conservative point estimate: 0.01%. Time horizon: setup 1–2 years; measurable gains 2–5 years; full effect 5–10 years. Confidence: low, because impacts are indirect, recommendations are non-binding, benefits depend on departmental uptake and coordination with the Auditor General, and many gains are timing/efficiency rather than new output.","Somewhat relevant for builders and entrepreneurs operating in modern treaty regions or on federally approved projects (resource development, infrastructure, housing) because improved federal implementation can reduce delays and uncertainty. It does not change underlying rights, introduce new funding programs, or alter permitting law; it establishes oversight and reporting only. Thus, potential business impact is indirect and uneven across sectors and regions.","Independent performance audits and public reporting that push federal departments to fix modern treaty implementation gaps, reducing approval delays and disputes for projects on treaty lands.",1–2 years to establish the Office; 2–5 years for measurable effects; full impact over 5–10 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
S-235,An Act respecting the National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking,3,0.005,low,"Affected sectors: public safety/law enforcement, federal public service (training/coordination), social services/NGOs; indirectly sectors where labour exploitation sometimes occurs (hospitality, agriculture, transportation, personal services). Mechanism: the bill statutorily locks in a national strategy, periodic reviews, and annual reporting, which (a) stabilizes and slightly expands federal program activity (training, coordination, awareness, data/website), and (b) marginally improves prevention, detection, and survivor reintegration. Scale and calculations (10‑year cumulative, relative to current ~$2.7T GDP): Assumed incremental program outlays of ~$12M/year (e.g., secretariat and training 50 FTE × $150k = $7.5M; awareness/website/data/consultations ≈ $4.5M) = ~$120M over 10 years → ~0.0044% of GDP. Conservative prevention/productivity effect: assume coordination and continuity prevent or shorten ~10 trafficking cases/year nationwide (a <1% change against likely thousands of actual cases). If each prevented/shortened case yields ~$200k of 10‑year GDP/labour income preserved (lost output, health/justice costs avoided), that is ~100 cases × $200k = ~$20M over 10 years → ~0.0007% of GDP. Combined ≈ $140M / $2.7T ≈ 0.0052%. Time horizon: most spending/coordination effects begin within 1–2 years; deterrence/survivor reintegration impacts accumulate over 2–5+ years. Constraints: the strategy already exists; this bill mainly ensures continuity and review rather than large new appropriations; results depend on provincial/municipal cooperation and enforcement capacity. Hence a small, positive, cumulative GDP impact well below 0.01%.","Primarily a public safety and social policy framework that codifies an existing federal strategy and adds review/reporting. It does not create new private‑sector mandates or broad economic reforms. Indirect business effects (e.g., in sectors susceptible to labour exploitation) are possible but limited and contingent on future program choices, not this statute itself. Some procurement opportunities for NGOs/service providers exist but are small relative to the overall economy.","Statutory continuity and periodic review of the federal anti‑trafficking strategy, leading to stable funding for coordination/training/awareness and marginally improved prevention and enforcement outcomes.","Immediate to 2 years for maintenance, website, training, and first review setup; 2–5 years for measurable prevention and reintegration effects; steady‑state thereafter with 5‑year review cycles.",2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-246,An Act to amend the Criminal Code (consecutive sentences for sexual offences),2,0.009,low,"Affected sectors: federal/provincial corrections, courts/legal services, and (marginally) victim services/healthcare and prison vendors. Mechanism: mandating consecutive sentences for sexual offences increases average time served for offenders with multiple sexual offence counts; this raises correctional operating spending and court workload, slightly reduces offender labour supply, and marginally reduces victimization via incapacitation (small productivity gains). Scale assumptions (conservative, order-of-magnitude): roughly 1,800 custodial sentences for sexual offences per year; ~15% (270) involve 2+ sexual offence counts or a new sexual offence while already serving; judges already impose consecutive terms in ~40% of these, so the incremental affected pool is ~162 offenders/year. Average added time due to mandatory consecutives: +1.0 year. Operating cost per inmate-year: ~$150,000. Added correctional spend: 162 inmate-years/year ≈ $24.3M/year, about $243M over 10 years. Court effects: more trials/longer proceedings as plea incentives fall—assume +75 trials/year at ~$60k each ≈ $4.5M/year, $45M over 10 years. Offsetting GDP effects: (a) lost offender output from extra incarceration—assume $30k per inmate-year of foregone output ≈ $4.86M/year, $48.6M over 10 years (negative); (b) incapacitation reduces offences slightly—assume 0.05 prevented incidents per additional offender-year ≈ ~8 incidents/year; avoided productivity losses ~$50k/incident ≈ $0.4M/year, $4M over 10 years (positive). Net 10-year GDP effect ≈ $243M + $45M − $48.6M + $4M ≈ $243.4M. Relative to ~$2.7T GDP, cumulative impact ≈ 0.009%. Time horizon: effects start immediately on coming-into-force for new sentences; correctional and court impacts ramp over 2–5 years and then plateau. Notes: (1) Some consecutive sentencing for sexual offences already occurs (especially across distinct victims), limiting incremental impact; (2) if governments offset higher justice spending with cuts elsewhere, net GDP impact tends toward zero; (3) deterrence beyond incapacitation is likely minimal. Confidence: low, due to limited public data on multi-count sentencing prevalence, behavioural responses (pleas/trials), and actual time-served deltas.","Primarily a criminal sentencing change with minimal direct implications for builders or entrepreneurs. Business-facing effects are indirect and small (marginal demand for legal services and corrections vendors). It does not alter taxes, permitting, financing, labour rules, or broad business regulation.","Mandates consecutive sentences for multiple sexual offences, increasing time served per affected offender and justice system spending",Immediate for new sentences upon coming into force; budgetary and prison-population effects accumulate over 2-5 years and stabilize by around year 5,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-245,An Act to amend the Canadian Multiculturalism Act (non-application in Quebec),2,0.002,medium,"Affected sectors: federal public administration in Quebec, community/non‑profit organizations receiving multiculturalism grants, and small DEI/training vendors. Mechanism: the bill removes the application of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act in Quebec, which likely reduces or reshapes federal multiculturalism-related grants in Quebec and eliminates related planning/reporting/compliance work by federal institutions operating there. Scale: the federal Multiculturalism Program and related initiatives are on the order of ~$30–50M/year nationally. Using Quebec’s ~22% population share implies ~$7–11M/year targeted to Quebec. Conservatively assume 50% of that is curtailed rather than reallocated within Quebec (others reallocated to other provinces), yielding a net national spending reduction of ~$3–5M/year. Add ~$1–2M/year in reduced compliance/reporting/training by federal institutions in Quebec. Total net change: ~$4–7M/year. Over 10 years this is ~$40–70M, or ~0.0015–0.0026% of current GDP ($2.7T). Conservative central estimate: 0.002%. Time horizon: legal change is immediate upon Royal Assent, with program and administrative adjustments phased in over 1–2 years. Indirect effects on immigration attraction/retention or private-sector diversity practices are highly uncertain and likely dominated by existing Quebec policies; they are not counted. Confidence: medium due to uncertainty over how much funding is curtailed versus reallocated and how departments operationalize the exemption.","The bill is primarily symbolic/administrative and does not change taxes, permits, labour law, or core business regulations. Any effects on private enterprises are indirect (e.g., minor shifts in federal grants to Quebec community groups or slightly reduced DEI expectations in federal-facing interactions). For most builders and entrepreneurs, operational impacts are negligible.","Removes application of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act in Quebec, reducing related federal grants and administrative/reporting obligations there.",Legal change on Royal Assent; program and reporting adjustments over 1–2 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
S-233,An Act to amend the Criminal Code (assault against persons who provide health services and first responders),2,0.0005,low,"Affected sectors: public and private health services (hospitals, long‑term care, home care, clinics) and first responders (paramedics, firefighters, some policing contexts). Mechanism: adds an aggravating factor at sentencing for assaults/threats against these workers, which likely (a) modestly increases average custody time for a subset of offenders and (b) may slightly deter incidents, reducing absenteeism, overtime, workers’ comp claims, and marginal turnover. Scale and conservative math: assume ≈12,000 police‑reported assaults per year involving these workers; ≈40% conviction rate (4,800); ≈30% result in custody (1,440). If the aggravating factor raises average custody by ~7 days, that adds ~10,000 custody days/year. At ≈$300/day, this is ≈$3.0M/year in additional correctional spending (~$30M over 10 years). Deterrence is uncertain; assume only ~1% reduction in incidents (~120 fewer/year). Using an average all‑in cost (lost time, overtime backfill, investigation, WSIB/insurance) of ≈$5,000 per incident yields ≈$0.6M/year savings. If perceived protection trims attrition by ~0.005% among ~800,000 high‑exposure health/EMS roles (~40 fewer separations/year) at ≈$25k per backfill/recruitment, that’s ≈$1.0M/year. Combined operational savings ≈$1.6M/year (~$16M over 10 years). Net fiscal/operational effect ≈$14M over 10 years, which is ~0.0005% of GDP. Timing: sentencing impacts are immediate; any deterrence/retention gains likely phase in over 2–5 years. Given high uncertainty on incident counts, conviction/custody shares, sentence deltas, and deterrence elasticity, confidence is low. Overall, the 10‑year cumulative GDP impact is negligible.","Primarily a criminal sentencing change with minimal direct implications for business operations. Indirect effects may slightly influence staffing costs and safety practices for health/EMS employers and private clinics, but there are no new compliance requirements or broad economic policy shifts. Limited relevance to builders and entrepreneurs outside of niche security or healthcare settings.","Requires courts to treat assaults on health workers and first responders as an aggravating factor at sentencing, modestly increasing average custody time and potentially deterring a small share of incidents.",Sentencing effect is immediate upon Royal Assent; any deterrence and workforce retention effects would materialize over 2–5 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
S-234,An Act respecting a national framework for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder,3,0.005,low,"Affected sectors: healthcare and social services (diagnosis, case management, training), research/education providers, Indigenous services, and indirectly beverage alcohol (via awareness messaging only). Mechanism: the bill mandates a national framework (standards, training, research sharing, and an awareness strategy) but does not itself fund new services or change alcohol regulations. Expected economic channel is modest: better diagnosis/standardized supports can slightly raise labour-force participation and job retention among adults with FASD and reduce administrative friction for service providers; plus a small one-time increase in federal spending to develop and communicate the framework. Scale: conservatively assume FASD prevalence at ~1% of Canadians (~410,000 people), with ~250,000 adults. If national standards/training lift effective employment among adults with FASD by an average of just 0.06 percentage points over 10 years (about 150 additional workers on average, ramping to ~300 by years 6–10), and average GDP per worker is ~$80,000, the 10‑year cumulative incremental output is ~150 × $80,000 × 10 ≈ $120 million. Add ~ $10 million in federal consultation/reporting/awareness spending during development and initial rollout, for a total ~ $130 million over 10 years. Relative to a ~$2.7 trillion GDP, this is ~0.005%. Time horizon: minimal near-term effects; framework due within 18 months, with most adoption and any employment/productivity gains materializing gradually in years 5–10. Offsetting effects on alcohol sales from pregnancy-focused awareness are negligible at the macro level and are not modeled. Confidence is low because outcomes depend on provincial/territorial uptake and future funding decisions not contained in this bill.","Primarily a health/social policy framework with indirect business implications. Near-term opportunities are limited to small contracts for research, training, and public awareness. Potential longer-run effects on labour participation are diffuse and uncertain.

C-244,"An Act to amend The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 and the Wrecked, Abandoned and Hazardous Vessels Act",4,0.002,low,"Affected sectors: marine shipping and tug/barge operators, commercial fisheries and aquaculture, marinas/ports, ship recycling/salvage yards, and marine insurers/lenders. Mechanism: the new Wrecked, Abandoned or Hazardous Vessels Act s.34.1 offence deters owners from offloading end‑of‑life vessels to under‑resourced buyers, pushing more responsible decommissioning/scrapping and reducing abandoned/derelict vessels, spill cleanups, and navigational hazards. The CEPA wording change appears clarificatory relative to existing dumping-at-sea permits; incremental compliance effects are likely minimal. Scale and conservative quantification: (a) Prevented derelicts: assume ~30 fewer abandoned/problem vessels per year nationwide due to enhanced transfer liability and penalties. Using a conservative $150,000 average removal/remediation cost per case implies ~$4.5M/year avoided. Over 10 years: ~$45M. (b) Spill/hazard avoidance: assume 1 major spill/hazard incident every two years attributable to derelict/problem vessels is prevented by the deterrent effect (0.5/year), at ~$1M in response and economic disruption per incident = ~$0.5M/year, or ~$5M over 10 years. (c) Minor port/marina closures and tourism/fishery disruptions avoided: ~$0.3M/year, or ~$3M over 10 years. (d) New compliance/due-diligence costs: assume ~400 higher‑risk vessel transfers/year face incremental documentation/inspection/insurance checks averaging ~$500 each = ~$0.2M/year, ~$2M over 10 years. Net 10‑year effect ≈ ($45M + $5M + $3M) − $2M = ~$51M, which is ~0.0019% of a $2.7T GDP. Rounded: 0.002%. Time horizon: compliance costs begin immediately upon in‑force; measurable reductions in derelict stock and associated savings accrue over 2–5 years, with most cumulative benefits realized over 5–10 years. Caveats: effects hinge on enforcement capacity and prosecutorial follow‑through; many derelict vessels stem from insolvency/legacy issues that may be only partially deterred.

C-243,An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (parole review),2,0.0001,low,"Affected sectors: federal corrections and parole administration (Correctional Service of Canada and Parole Board of Canada), with minor spillovers to legal services. Mechanism: the bill eliminates offender-initiated reapplications for day/full parole after denial or cancellation for first/second-degree murder, defaulting to statutory review intervals only. This reduces hearing volume and related casework, but may lengthen time in custody for a small subset who would otherwise have been granted earlier release upon reapplication. Scale: PBC issues ~16,000 conditional release decisions annually; lifer cases are a small subset (hundreds). Conservatively assume 150–250 offender-initiated early reapplication hearings/year are eliminated (midpoint 200). Loaded per-hearing administrative cost (PBC hearing time, CSC case preparation, victim services/logistics) ~ $9,000, implying ~$1.8M/year gross savings. Assume ~5% of those reapplicants (10/year) would have secured earlier release by ~1 year on average; added custody cost per inmate ≈ $150k/year → ~$1.5M/year added cost. Net impact ≈ +$0.3M/year savings, or ~$3M over 10 years. Time horizon: administrative savings begin immediately; custody-time effects phase in as reviews occur (within 2–5 years).

C-242,An Act to amend the Criminal Code and the Department of Justice Act,4,0.03,low,"Affected sectors: provincial/territorial corrections, courts/Crown/legal aid, policing, retail/hospitality/insurance (via crime), and to a lesser extent security services and legaltech (from the new annual reporting). Mechanism: the bill tightens bail by (i) replacing the restraint principle with public safety as primary, (ii) expanding reverse‑onus for violent indictable offences and creating a 'major offence' class, (iii) barring officer‑in‑charge releases for major offences, (iv) requiring superior‑court bail for certain repeat major offenders, (v) ending release between guilty plea and sentencing for indictable offences, (vi) making the risk standard 'reasonably foreseeable' rather than 'substantial likelihood', and (vii) imposing passport holds for non‑citizens/PRs. Net effects: more pre‑trial and pre‑sentence detention (raising corrections/court spending), modest reductions in offences committed while on release (lowering some business losses and policing demand), and small labor‑supply losses from additional remand time. Scale (conservative, national, steady‑state per year): (1) Extra detention pending sentencing for indictable pleas: ~15,000 cases × 14 days ≈ 210,000 bed‑days (~575 average daily inmates; ~$73M/year at ~$350/day). (2) Expanded reverse‑onus + lower risk standard for major offences: ~20,000 bail cases × +10 pp higher detention × 45 days ≈ 90,000 bed‑days (~247 ADP; ~$31M/year). (3) No peace‑officer release for major offences: ~10,000 incidents × +1 day ≈ 10,000 bed‑days (~27 ADP; ~$3.5M/year). (4) Superior‑court bail for repeat major offenders: ~1,000 cases × +7 days ≈ 7,000 bed‑days (~19 ADP; ~$2.4M/year). (5) Small system‑wide shift from 'reasonably foreseeable' standard: ~100,000 bail decisions × +1 pp initial detention × 7 extra days ≈ 7,000 bed‑days (~19 ADP; ~$2.4M/year). Total ≈ 324,000 additional bed‑days (~887 ADP) → ~$113M/year in operating costs. Add court/Crown/policing overhead for more/longer bail proceedings ≈ $30M/year. Business‑side benefits from incapacitation of high‑risk offenders while on release are modest (prevented offences while on bail/pending sentence on the order of a few hundred to low thousands/year), yielding ~$5–$15M/year in reduced retail shrink, property damage, and insurance‑related costs (use $7M midpoint). Lost private‑sector output from additional remand: ~887 ADP × 30% employed × ~$60k GDP/worker FTE ≈ $16M/year. Net measured GDP effect (government consumption minus lost output plus business savings) ≈ +$113M + $30M − $16M + $7M ≈ +$134M/year. Applying a 40% haircut for constitutional challenges, judicial interpretation, and provincial capacity limits yields ≈ +$80M/year. Over 10 years ≈ $0.8B, or about 0.03% of a $2.7T GDP.

C-241,An Act to establish a national strategy respecting flood and drought forecasting,6,0.005,low,"Affected sectors: agriculture (~190,000 farms; ~$40B primary agriculture GDP), property and casualty insurance (flood risk underwriting), construction/infrastructure planning, utilities (hydropower and municipal water), transportation and municipalities in floodplains, and water/climate-tech vendors. Mechanism: the Act mandates only a national strategy (not a funded service). If acted upon within existing authorities, it can modestly improve coordination, data-sharing, and standardized risk maps/forecasts, enabling earlier protective actions (sandbagging, equipment relocation), better reservoir and irrigation scheduling, and more accurate insurance pricing—reducing avoidable damage and business interruption. Scale and calculation: conservative baseline annual economic losses from floods/drought in Canada ~$5B (insured + uninsured). Incremental reduction attributable to a national coordination strategy over existing provincial forecasting assumed at 0.3% once partially implemented, i.e., ~$15M/year. Benefits realistically begin in year 4 and run through years 4–10: ~$15M × 7 = ~$105M. Secondary effects: (a) agricultural planning/yield protection: assume 10% of agricultural output is moderately drought-affected in a typical year; better forecasts avert ~0.1% of losses → ~0.001 × 0.10 × $40B ≈ $4M/year for 6 years ≈ $24M; (b) modest hydropower/water-operations optimization and construction scheduling gains: ~+$3M/year for 6 years ≈ $18M. Total 10‑year cumulative ≈ $105M + $24M + $18M = ~$147M. Relative to ~$2.7T GDP, this is ~0.147B / 2,700B ≈ 0.005% (cumulative over 10 years). Time horizon: strategy due within 2 years; practical benefits likely begin 3–5 years post‑enactment as provinces/municipalities integrate outputs, ramping in years 5–10. Confidence: low—this bill does not fund or establish an operational service; impacts depend on provincial cooperation and separate federal/provincial investments, so realized benefits could be near zero without follow‑on action.","Somewhat relevant to builders and entrepreneurs. Direct business changes are limited because the bill only mandates a strategy, not implementation. However, it can create future procurement and open-data opportunities for water/climate-tech firms, geospatial and risk-analytics startups, and provides planning inputs for developers, insurers, and agriculture.

C-240,"An Act to amend the Criminal Code, to make related amendments to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act",4,0.008,low,"Affected sectors: corrections (federal CSC and, to a limited extent, provincial/territorial facilities), in-custody education/training providers (e.g., CORCAN, accredited programs), addictions treatment providers, and indirectly employers needing entry-level and trades labour. Mechanism: the bill allows courts to prescribe in-custody measures (training/treatment) and requires CSC to reflect court-ordered programs in correctional plans and parole assessments. This slightly raises program completion rates by creating clearer expectations and incentives; the fentanyl amendment may modestly increase sentences for large-scale traffickers. Scale and conservative quantification: (1) New custodial sentences ~35,000 annually (federal ~5,000; provincial sentenced custody ~30,000). Assume judicial uptake reaches 20% after ramp-up → ~7,000 orders/year. Given existing programming and the 'subject to availability' and 'program director acceptance' constraints, assume only 20% of ordered cases result in incremental completions beyond the status quo → ~1,400 additional completions/year. (2) Employment effect: evidence on correctional education suggests a 5–10 percentage-point increase in post-release employment; use 6% for conservatism → ~84 additional employed people per cohort-year. Assume average 2 years of employment per person spread over the 10-year horizon → ~168 added job-years per annual cohort; at ~$80,000 GDP per job-year, ≈$13.4M GDP per cohort. Over 10 cohorts ≈$134M. (3) Direct program spending: average incremental cost $3,000 per additional completion (many orders are low-cost like victim letters; training/treatment is costlier) → ~$4.2M/year, ~$42M over 10 years (adds to GDP as government consumption). (4) Fentanyl aggravating factor: assume ~40 convictions/year meet the 'large-scale' threshold, adding on average 0.5 extra year → ~20 inmate-years/year. At ~$180,000 per inmate-year ≈$3.6M/year, ~$36M over 10 years (adds to GDP via government spending; deterrence or public-safety gains are not quantified). Cumulative 10-year GDP effect ≈$134M + $42M + $36M = ~$212M, which is ~0.008% of annual GDP ($2.7T). Time horizon: impacts ramp in 2–5 years as courts adopt orders and programming capacity adjusts; employment and recidivism effects materialize 2–5+ years post-sentencing. Implementation risks: provincial participation is not mandated; capacity constraints ('subject to availability') and offender consent for treatment limit uptake; parole boards already consider progress, so marginal change may be small. Given these uncertainties and reliance on discretionary uptake, confidence is low.","Some indirect relevance for builders and entrepreneurs: modest potential boost to post-release labour supply (especially for entry-level and trades roles) and marginal improvements in public safety that can reduce business losses. However, effects are small, contingent on program availability and judicial uptake, and the bill does not change taxes, permitting, competition policy, or core business regulations. Hence, only somewhat relevant.","Enables courts to order in-custody training/treatment and ties parole assessments to progress, modestly increasing program completion and post-release employment; plus slightly longer sentences for large-scale fentanyl traffickers.",2-5 years (judicial uptake and program capacity ramp-up; provincial participation is discretionary and capacity-limited),2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-239,An Act to amend the Canada Health Act (accountability),4,0.007,low,"Affected sectors: provincial health systems (hospitals, ER, primary care, physician offices), health IT/analytics vendors, and employers indirectly via worker productivity. Mechanism: ties full Canada Health Transfer cash to provincial accountability frameworks with public benchmarks on timely access and efficiency reporting, creating mild performance pressure that can reduce wait times and nudge process improvements; no new funding or structural reform is mandated. Scale (conservative): (1) Physician/clinic output measured in GDP (~1.8% of GDP ≈ $48B/yr) could see a very small throughput gain from benchmarking/public reporting of 0.05% at full effect, worth ≈$24M/yr; assuming a gradual ramp and partial adoption, ≈$120M cumulative over 10 years. (2) Labour productivity from shorter waits: assume ~100,000 employed patients annually in conditions where delays impair work; a 0.5% reduction to a typical 50‑day wait recovers 0.25 days per case → 25,000 days/yr at full effect. Using ≈$540 GDP per worker‑day (2.7T GDP / ~20M workers / ~250 days), that is ≈$13.5M/yr. Add ~5,000 days/yr (≈$2.7M/yr) from modest primary‑care/ER access improvements. With a 3–4 year ramp and partial compliance, ≈$80–90M cumulative over 10 years. Total positive impact ≈$200M cumulative, or ~0.007% of GDP. Offsets/limits: reporting/compliance costs are largely reallocations within provincial budgets, and enforcement under the Canada Health Act has historically been limited, so realized gains may be smaller. Time horizon: impacts start ~years 3–4, with most gains in years 5–10.

C-238,An Act to amend the Criminal Code (restitution orders),3,0.0005,medium,"C-238 expands restitution orders so courts can require offenders convicted of human trafficking (Criminal Code ss. 279.01–279.02) and certain drug offences (CDSA ss. 5, 6, 7.1) to reimburse non-individual front-line service providers (e.g., emergency, harm reduction, victim support) for reasonable, readily ascertainable costs. Mechanism: small transfers from offenders to organizations for items like emergency medical supplies, shelter, security, counselling, and incremental staffing/training. Scale assumptions: roughly 2,000 eligible convictions nationwide per year; about 15% yield organizational restitution orders given evidentiary and ability-to-pay limits (~300 orders/year). Average order ~$25,000 with an estimated 40% collection rate → ~$3.0M/year collected, or ~$30M over 10 years. Because restitution is largely a transfer (offenders would otherwise spend some of this money), assume only ~50% is net-additive to service delivery capacity (~$15M over 10 years). Additional court/admin time to assess/enforce orders estimated at ~$0.3M/year (~$3M over 10 years). Net incremental economic activity ≈ $12M over 10 years, which is ~0.0005% of one-year GDP ($2.7T). Any deterrence or community-safety spillovers are likely too small to materially change this order of magnitude.

Mechanism: (1) Harmonized, spawning‑based close times and mandatory two‑month advance publication reduce uncertainty and scheduling conflicts, enabling earlier marketing and more trip bookings; (2) A new catch‑monitoring/reporting system improves data for stock management but adds modest compliance friction; (3) DFO procurement to build/operate the monitoring system injects spending into IT/compliance services. Scale: Atlantic recreational groundfish activity is on the order of $200–300M/year (150–200k participants; ~1M trips; ~$120–$150/trip). Conservative effects assumed: +3% increase in trips/spend from harmonization + advance notice = +$6–9M/year; −1% participation drag from new reporting requirements for the first 3 years = roughly −$2–3M/year for 3 years (≈ −$7.5M total); DFO monitoring procurement ≈ $5M setup + $3M/year O&M over 9 years ≈ $32M over 10 years; modest stock‑stability/planning benefits from better data of ~$1M/year in years 4–10 (≈ $7M). Net 10‑year incremental GDP ≈ $75M (trip gains) − $7.5M (friction) + $32M (procurement) + $7M (stability) ≈ $106.5M. As a share of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP, that is ≈ 0.004% over 10 years. Time horizon: planning/booking effects start within 1–2 seasons; data/sustainability benefits materialize in 3–7 years.

C-236,"An Act to amend the Criminal Code, the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and the Prisons and Reformatories Act",2,0.0001,high,"Affected sectors: justice system (courts, policing), federal/provincial corrections, parole boards. Mechanism: (a) treating non-disclosure of remains as an aggravating factor and (b) enabling courts to require up to 50% of sentence (max 10 years) before full parole, plus explicit authority for parole boards to refuse release/temporary absences. Scale: Canada sees ~800 homicides/year. A small subset (≈1% ≈ 8 cases/year) involve offenders who know but refuse to disclose the location of remains. Of these, assume ~4 are non-life sentences (e.g., manslaughter) and ~4 are life sentences. For the ~4 non-life cases, shifting parole eligibility from 1/3 to 1/2 adds on average ~0.5 inmate-years each (recognizing many are denied parole regardless) ≈ 2 inmate-years. For the ~4 life cases, codifying non-disclosure as a reason to deny parole adds ~0.25 inmate-years each ≈ 1 inmate-year. At ≈$150k per inmate-year, added corrections spend ≈$0.45M/year. Deterrence/cooperation could prompt disclosure in ~1–2 cases/year, reducing search/investigation costs by ≈$0.3M per case (≈$0.45M/year). Net fiscal effect ≈ $0M–$0.3M/year; central ≈ $0.1M/year.

C-235,An Act to amend the Criminal Code (increasing parole ineligibility),2,0.0002,high,"Affected sectors: federal/provincial justice systems (courts, prosecution/defence, corrections), legal services. Mechanism: the bill allows judges to increase parole ineligibility from 25 to up to 40 years for offenders convicted of abduction + sexual assault + murder of the same victim. Near-term economic effects are limited to slightly longer sentencing proceedings and potential constitutional litigation; additional incarceration years occur only after 25 years, outside the 10‑year horizon. Scale: Canada records roughly 750–900 homicides/year; sexual-assault-related homicides are ~1–2% of cases, and the subset also involving abduction is rarer. Conservatively assume 2–4 qualifying convictions/year (≈3/year). Incremental court time to argue parole ineligibility (≈1 day/case at ~$15k/day) ≈ $45k/year → ~$0.45M over 10 years. National training/guidance updates across justice partners ≈ $0.5–1.0M one-time. Likely Charter litigation (given recent jurisprudence limiting extended parole ineligibility) could cost governments several million; assume $3–7M over 10 years (midpoint ~$5M). Total incremental government spending within 10 years ≈ $6–6.5M. Relative to ~$2.7T GDP, that is ~0.00022–0.00024%, rounded to 0.0002%. Deterrence effects for such rare crimes are uncertain and, even if present, would shift only a handful of cases over a decade, yielding negligible GDP changes. Time horizon: sentencing changes are immediate; meaningful incarceration cost changes arise 25–40 years after conviction, beyond this window. Confidence: high that the 10-year impact is far below 0.01%, regardless of litigation outcomes.","This is a narrow criminal sentencing change with no direct implications for business regulation, taxation, permitting, labour markets, or capital formation.

C-234,An Act respecting the establishment and award of a Living Donor Recognition Medal,2,0.0002,low,"Affected sectors: health care (transplant programs and dialysis providers), non-profit donation organizations, and small vendors that produce medals/host ceremonies. Mechanism: symbolic recognition and public ceremonies marginally increase social signaling and awareness, nudging a small increase in living organ donations; this can shorten time on dialysis and enable some recipients (and caregivers) to return to work sooner. Scale: Canada sees roughly 600–700 living donors per year. Assuming a conservative 0.5% uplift once the medal is established (≈3–4 additional donors per year) starting in year 2 and continuing for 9 years yields ≈29 extra transplants over 10 years. If ~60% of recipients are working-age, ~17 people could regain work capacity averaging ~2.5 FTE‑years each over the decade (~42.5 FTE‑years). Using ≈$100,000 GDP per worker‑year implies ≈$4.25M. Add modest caregiver time freed (≈0.6 FTE‑years each for 17 caregivers ≈10.2 FTE‑years ≈$1.0M). Total incremental GDP ≈$5.3M over 10 years. Relative to ~$2.7T GDP, that is ~0.0002%. Direct program costs (medal design, ceremonies, administration) are likely <$1M/year and largely represent budget reallocations within health/government, so they have little net effect on GDP; health-system cost savings from fewer dialysis years are also typically reallocated to other care rather than reducing GDP. Time horizon: effects would start after setup (year 2) and accrue gradually over years 2–10. Confidence: low, because the behavioral response to an honorific medal could be close to zero, capacity constraints could limit additional procedures, and some living donations may substitute for deceased-donor transplants rather than adding net procedures.","Primarily ceremonial and health-system–focused.

Mechanism: Mandates maximum-security classification and custody for all dangerous offenders and inmates convicted of more than one first-degree murder, preventing step-downs to medium security and associated unescorted temporary absences. This raises per-inmate operating costs and may require limited max-security area retrofits. Scale: Approx. 850 dangerous offenders in custody and ~120 inmates with multiple first-degree murder convictions. Conservatively assume 25% of dangerous offenders (≈213) and 30% of multiple-murder lifers (≈36) are not currently in max; total ≈249 inmates moved/kept at max. Incremental operating cost difference max vs. medium ≈ $60,000 per inmate-year (CSC benchmarks). Annual O&M increase ≈ 249 × $60k = $14.94M. Pipeline additions: ~35 new dangerous offender designations and ~5 multiple-murder cases per year; assuming 30% would otherwise step down over time yields an average additional 80 inmates in max instead of medium over the decade (80 × $60k = $4.8M/year). Ten-year O&M total ≈ ($14.94M + $4.8M) × 10 = $197M. Capital: modest retrofits to convert/expand max-security areas (e.g., 150 beds at ~$150k/bed) ≈ $22.5M over first 3 years. Administrative offsets from fewer unescorted temporary absences for this cohort are small (≈ −$2M over 10 years) because such absences are rare. Net 10-year incremental public spending ≈ $197M + $22.5M − $2M ≈ $215M. As a share of ~$2.7T GDP, ≈ $215M / $2.7T ≈ 0.008%. Time horizon: Operating cost impacts begin within 1–2 years as classifications are updated; capital impacts occur mainly in years 1–4; effects persist through years 5–10 as the cohort ages.

C-9,"An Act to amend the Criminal Code (hate propaganda, hate crime and access to religious or cultural places)",4,0.0012,low,"Affected sectors: religious and cultural institutions (non-profits), nearby retail/hospitality, event venues, insurers, and private security. Mechanism: (1) Creates a stand‑alone hate‑crime offence (s.320.1001) with higher maximum penalties for any underlying offence when motivated by hatred, which modestly increases deterrence and prosecutorial clarity beyond existing sentencing enhancements; (2) creates a new offence for intimidation/obstruction of access to buildings primarily used for religious worship or by identifiable groups and to cemeteries (s.423.3), reducing access‑blocking incidents and event cancellations; (3) adds the new offence to the Part VI intercept list (s.183) and DNA order eligibility (s.487.04), modestly improving enforcement. Scale: Canada sees roughly 3,000–5,000 police‑reported hate crimes annually; about 55–60% are mischief/property damage. Conservatively assume 1,800 property‑mischief incidents/year with average direct repair/cleanup and operational disruption of ~$7,500 each (~$13.5M baseline cost). A 10% reduction from added deterrence/enforcement yields ~$1.35M/year in avoided losses. For access‑blocking, assume ~400 incidents/year across worship/cultural sites causing cancellations or curtailed access, with average lost output (on‑site spending/donations, rescheduling/security, nearby small‑business spillovers) of ~$12.5k/incident (~$5M baseline); a 25% reduction from the new, clearer offence yields ~$1.25M/year. Include a small spillover benefit to adjacent commerce from fewer disruptions (~$0.5M/year). Time horizon: legal effect 30 days after Royal Assent; practical deterrence ramps over ~2–3 years as police and prosecutors apply the new provisions. Using a ramped profile, average net gain ≈ $3.2M/year over 10 years ≈ $32M total, or ~0.0012% of a $2.7T GDP. Notes: we do not count increased enforcement/incarceration spending as a net GDP gain (likely a budget reallocation). Offsetting risks include substitution (incidents moving to non‑covered locations) and case‑law uncertainty around hate‑speech provisions. Confidence: low, because incident volumes, unit costs, and behavioral responses are uncertain and indirect effects are hard to quantify; the estimate is deliberately conservative and small.","Some relevance to entrepreneurs but indirect. The bill mainly targets criminal conduct around religious/cultural sites rather than core business regulation. Potential benefits include fewer access disruptions and lower vandalism risk for a narrow set of venues and nearby small businesses, and marginal insurance/security impacts. No new compliance duties for typical firms, and macroeconomic effects are minimal. More relevant to operators of religious/cultural facilities, event organizers, and insurers than to the broader business community.","Introduces a stand‑alone hate‑crime offence and criminalizes intimidation/obstruction of access to religious/cultural sites, modestly deterring vandalism and access‑blocking incidents.",Comes into force 30 days after Royal Assent; measurable deterrence and enforcement effects likely over 2–3 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-230,An Act to amend the Financial Administration Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts (debt forgiveness registry),4,0.002,low,"Affected sectors: large corporate taxpayers across all industries (corporations/partnerships/trusts), federal public administration, and legal/accounting/compliance services; minor IT services demand. Mechanism: creating a public, searchable registry of >$1M federal debts/claims that were waived, written off, or forgiven introduces reputational and political scrutiny, which can (i) deter discretionary remissions/write‑offs, (ii) encourage earlier settlement to avoid listing, and (iii) tighten internal controls at departments/CRA; plus a small one‑time/ongoing IT spend to build/operate the registry. Scale: Public Accounts routinely report several billions in annual write‑offs/forgiveness across all taxpayers; conservatively assume $0.5–$1.5B per year pertains to corporations with single accounts ≥$1M (roughly 100–250 cases averaging $4–$10M), midpoint ~$1.0B. Transparency-driven behavioural change plausibly reduces such amounts by ~2% (=~$20M/year) through fewer discretionary remissions or improved collections; most large write‑offs are insolvency-driven and unaffected. Time horizon: 12–24 months to stand up the registry; behavioural effects phase in over 2–5 years. GDP math (conservative): assume 30% of recovered revenue is re-spent with a 0.7 multiplier (rest reduces deficit) → ~$4.2M/year GDP; government IT outlays ~$12M one-time + ~$2M/year O&M (~$30M over 10 years) → ≈$3M/year GDP; minor added legal/comms frictions netted at −$1M/year.

C-233,An Act to amend the Export and Import Permits Act,6,0.03,low,"Affected sectors: defence and security manufacturing (armoured vehicles, aerospace and avionics, optics and sensors, shipbuilding components, munitions), defence tech services, and brokers/logistics. Scale: Canadian military goods and technology exports are roughly $4–6B per year; a conservative midpoint of $5B is used (non‑US reported exports ~2–3B; US flows are not fully reported but industry sources suggest a similar magnitude). Approximately 700–900 firms and ~50–70k workers participate in this supply chain. Mechanisms: (1) Eliminates general export and brokering permits for military goods (notably ending GEP‑47 to the US after a 180‑day grace period), forcing firm- and contract‑specific permits; (2) requires re‑permitting of existing permits within 180 days, causing a one‑time backlog; (3) clarifies that parts/components/technology necessary for assembly/use are covered, modestly expanding the set of controlled items; (4) adds potential end‑use certificate requirements where substantial risk is identified, increasing processing time for some destinations. Time horizon: immediate shock at 180 days; most impacts in years 1–3; steady‑state friction thereafter. Quantification (conservative): (a) Lost/delayed exports from permitting friction estimated at 2% of the affected flow for the first 3 years and 1% for the following 7 years: 0.02*5B*3 + 0.01*5B*7 ≈ $0.65B over 10 years. (b) Industry compliance and working‑capital costs from added permits and brokering approvals ≈ $10–15M per year after year 1 plus a transition spike (~$20–30M) during the first two years; assume $0.14B over 10 years. Total 10‑year cumulative impact ≈ $0.79B. As a share of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP, this is ~0.029% (rounded to 0.03%). Key uncertainties: Global Affairs Canada’s actual permit throughput and ability to issue multi‑year, multi‑shipment permits to reduce friction; whether end‑use certificate requirements will rarely apply to the US (likely) but more often to a subset of non‑US destinations; potential industry adaptation (consolidating permits, adjusting logistics). These uncertainties drive the low confidence but the central estimate remains in the minor range.","Somewhat relevant to builders and entrepreneurs overall, but directly relevant to defence exporters, aerospace suppliers, and brokers.

C-223,An Act to amend the Divorce Act,2,0.004,low,"Affected sectors: legal services (family law), provincial courts/justice system, and—indirectly—labour markets for custodial parents. Mechanisms: (1) Mandatory family‑violence risk screening by lawyers adds modest billable time and some training; (2) clearer consideration of coercive control likely lengthens some hearings slightly; (3) relocation burden-of-proof change marginally increases approved relocations, improving labour mobility and earnings for some custodial parents. Scale: Canada records ~50,000 divorces/year; assume ~60% with legal counsel (~30,000 cases). Added screening/safety planning averages ~1.25 hours per counselled case at ~$300/hour ≈ $11.25M/year, or ~$112.5M over 10 years. One‑off lawyer training: ~8,000 family lawyers × 3 hours × $250/hour ≈ $6M (year 1-2). Court time: ~8,000 contested matters/year with +0.25 hour at ~$350/hour ≈ $0.7M/year, ~$7M over 10 years. Transitional re-litigation due to variation orders: ~1,000 extra motions over first 2 years at ~3 hours per side × 2 × $300/hour ≈ ~$2M. Labour mobility: relocation standard likely increases approvals by ~75/year; assume average incremental earnings of ~$3,000/year for ~4 years per case (job access/family support), yielding roughly $9M over 10 years within the window. Time horizon: legal/court spending impacts begin immediately upon in-force; mobility and child‑safety effects accumulate over 2–5+ years. Net 10‑year incremental economic activity ≈ $125M–$135M, which is ~0.004%–0.005% of $2.7T GDP; we report 0.004% to be conservative.

C-225,An Act to amend the Criminal Code,3,0.008,low,"Affected sectors: policing, courts/Crown, provincial corrections (remand), forensic/psychological assessment services, evidence storage, and—indirectly—employers via worker absenteeism related to intimate partner violence (IPV). Mechanisms: (1) mandatory non‑release by police for certain IPV arrests increases remand bed‑days and bail hearings; (2) new 7‑day risk‑of‑reoffending assessments add custody days and assessment costs; (3) creating IPV‑specific offences and designating intimate‑partner murder as first‑degree may slightly increase court time and custodial days; (4) extending seized-property detention from 3 months to 1 year raises storage/handling costs. Scale and conservative calculations (annual): • Police‑release restriction: assume ~120,000 police‑reported IPV victims/year; ~60,000 charges; ~15% with relevant prior/release status ⇒ ~9,000 cases. Added average 1 custody day per case ⇒ ~9,000 bed‑days × $250/day ≈ $2.25M. • Risk assessments: assume 2,000 orders/year; 7 days each ⇒ 14,000 bed‑days × $250/day ≈ $3.5M; plus ~$1,500 per assessment for clinicians/admin ≈ $3.0M; subtotal ≈ $6.5M. • Court time: ~9,000 added bail hearings + 2,000 assessment hearings ≈ 11,000 events × ~$700 all‑in/event (judge/Crown/defence/court staff) ≈ $7.7M. • Seized‑property storage: assume incremental 12,000 items/year held longer × ~$100 storage/handling ≈ $1.2M. • Sentencing/charging effects: modest increase in custodial exposure (e.g., +5,000 inmate‑days) ≈ $1.25M. • Training/admin/policing overhead ≈ $2.0M. Gross incremental public spend ≈ $20.9M/year. Potential productivity gains from fewer repeat incidents are small and uncertain: if measures prevent ~2% of repeat incidents among ~9,000 high‑risk cases ⇒ ~180 incidents avoided/year; assume ~5 lost workdays avoided/incident at ~$540 GDP/worker‑day ⇒ ≈ $0.5M/year in added output. Net GDP change (government spending enters GDP; small productivity gain also adds): ≈ $21–22M/year. Over 10 years, ≈ $210–220M total, which is ≈ 0.008% of a $2.7T GDP. Time horizon: most spending impacts are immediate to 1–2 years post‑implementation; any crime‑reduction productivity effects likely accrue over 2–5 years and remain modest.

C-227,An Act to establish a national strategy on housing for young Canadians,5,0.001,low,"What the bill does: mandates a federal strategy, consultations, one conference, and reporting on housing for 17–34-year-olds. It does not change zoning, permitting, taxation, or create funded programs. Affected sectors: residential construction (multi-family rental, student housing, co-ops, entry-level ownership), real estate development/management, mortgage/lending, municipal planning, youth-serving nonprofits. Mechanisms: (1) information/coordination effects (centralized guidance/portal, best-practice sharing) that reduce search/compliance time for young households and project sponsors; (2) small acceleration/soft-cost reduction on a handful of youth/student-housing projects due to better intergovernmental alignment and program uptake. Scale assumptions (conservative, 10-year cumulative): - Portal/knowledge-sharing: 200,000 young Canadians/year use centralized resources starting in year 2; 0.25 hours saved each at $25/hour for 8 years ≈ $10M of time savings. - Developers/lenders/municipal staff: ~200 organizations save 10 hours/year at $80/hour for 5 years ≈ $8M. - Project financing/soft-cost savings: 10 youth/student/co-op projects over a decade (≈$30M each) achieve 0.2% lower carrying/soft costs via earlier alignment ≈ $6M. - Federal admin/outreach spending to run the strategy/conference/reporting: ~$12–16M over 10 years. Combined gross impact ≈ $36–40M. Conservatively, we attribute ≈$27M (0.001% of $2.7T GDP) as the 10-year cumulative GDP effect, given voluntary provincial/municipal uptake and the non-binding nature of the strategy.

C-228,"An Act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Act (prior review of treaties by Parliament)",4,-0.003,low,"Mechanisms: (1) a statutory requirement to obtain House committee advice on “major treaties” can slightly extend time-to-ratification/modification for trade/investment agreements; (2) small ongoing administrative costs for memoranda and publication; (3) marginal transparency/quality gains. Baseline: since 2008, Canada already tables treaties for 21 sitting days with an explanatory memo, so the bill largely codifies existing practice; the incremental change is the mandatory advice/review step and hard publication deadlines. Conservative quantification: assume an average incremental delay of 5 calendar days for major economic treaties (exception clause in s.12.4 curbs longer delays). Over 10 years, assume one major FTA/renegotiation with an average annual GDP gain of 0.2%, plus four smaller economic treaties/modifications averaging 0.005% annual gains each. One-time GDP foregone inside the 10-year window from a 5-day delay ≈ (0.2% × 5/365) + 4 × (0.005% × 5/365) ≈ 0.0030% of GDP.

C-229,An Act to establish a national framework respecting attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,4,0.02,low,"This bill establishes a national framework (guidance, training resources, access pathways) without mandating programs or funding. Any GDP effects come indirectly from earlier diagnosis and wider use of evidence‑based ADHD treatment, plus better school supports. Affected sectors: healthcare providers (family physicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses), K‑12/ post‑secondary education, pharma, training/edtech, and digital health. Mechanism: provider/educator training and guidance increases accurate assessment and appropriate treatment; this raises on‑the‑job productivity for adults with ADHD, reduces absenteeism and accidents, and modestly reduces caregiving time burdens for families. Scale and conservative calculation: (1) Population with ADHD ≈ 1.0M; working‑age ≈ 65% → 650k. Assume 40% untreated or mismanaged (260k). As a framework (not funding), assume it results in appropriate diagnosis/treatment for 10% of the untreated by year 10 → ~26k adults. (2) Conservative productivity gain per newly and properly treated adult: 4%. With ~$100k GDP per worker, annual steady‑state gain ≈ 26,000 × $100,000 × 4% ≈ $104M/year by year 10. Assuming a 2‑year setup and linear ramp through years 3–10, cumulative ≈ 0.5 × $104M × 8 ≈ $416M. (3) Caregiver/parent time: assume 10k families regain 100 hours/year at $30/hour once mature → ~$30M/year; cumulative over ramp ≈ $120M. (4) Modest reductions in accidents/comorbidities/absences add an estimated ~$50M cumulative over 10 years. (5) Subtract implementation/training opportunity costs (e.g., 50k educators + 20k clinicians × 4 hours × ~$60/hour plus content development) ≈ $50M one‑time. Net 10‑year cumulative ≈ $416M + $120M + $50M − $50M ≈ $536M, or ~0.02% of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP. Time horizon: minimal impact until year 3; benefits accrue mainly in years 3–10.

C-221,An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (disclosure of information to victims),2,0.0001,high,"Affected sectors: Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), Parole Board of Canada (PBC), and federal victim services administration; negligible private-sector involvement. Mechanism: Requires that victim notifications about temporary absences/releases/parole eligibility and review dates include an explanation of how those dates were determined. This adds a short drafting/verification step per notification and minor IT/template updates and training. Scale: Canada processes on the order of 15,000–30,000 relevant notifications annually to registered victims. Assuming an added 10 minutes of staff time per notification at a fully loaded $55/hour implies ~$9.17 per notification. At 20,000 notifications/year, incremental operating cost ≈ $183k/year. Add a one-time IT/template/training cost of ~$0.4–$0.7M and modest annual maintenance (~$25–$50k). Ten-year cumulative cost is conservatively ~$2.2–$2.6M (central case ≈ $2.5M). Even without offsetting reductions in follow-up inquiries, this equals ~0.00009% of current GDP ($2.5M / $2.7T), rounded here to 0.0001%. Time horizon: One-time setup within 6–12 months of Royal Assent; ongoing minor administrative workload thereafter. Confidence: High that the impact is negligible and far below 0.01% of GDP; moderate on exact counts and unit costs, but variations do not change the conclusion.

C-220,An Act to amend the Criminal Code (immigration status in sentencing),2,0.006,low,"Affected sectors: provincial/federal corrections and courts, CBSA removals (immigration enforcement), and employers with some non‑citizen workers (hospitality, agriculture, construction, services, and some tech). Mechanism: by barring judges from considering immigration consequences in sentencing, some non‑citizen offenders who might previously have received shorter sentences to avoid deportation will instead receive slightly longer custodial sentences and face more removals from Canada. This raises public-sector costs (incarceration and removals) and creates a very small, mostly temporary labour‑supply reduction for employers. Scale: Canada completes roughly 200k+ adult criminal court cases annually. Assuming ~35% receive custody (~70k) and ~20% of those exceed six months (~14k), and non‑citizens comprise ~12% of offenders, about 1,700 non‑citizen cases per year involve 6+ month custody exposure. Only a subset are close enough to the immigration thresholds (e.g., six months) for sentencing to have been adjusted under current jurisprudence; assume 300 such cases/yr would have been mitigated previously. If average additional incarceration is ~2.5 months, that adds ~62.5 inmate‑years/yr, at ~$120k/inmate‑year ≈ $7.5M/yr. Additional removals: assume ~200 more enforced removals/yr at ~$20k each ≈ $4.0M/yr. Labour/GDP effect: net of replacement through ongoing immigration and labour churn, assume ~50 net worker‑years lost/yr at ~$120k GDP/worker ≈ $6.0M/yr. Net annual impact ≈ $17.5M; over 10 years ≈ $175M, or ~0.006–0.007% of current GDP. Time horizon: effects begin immediately upon Royal Assent for new sentencings; removals and labour impacts phase in over 1–3 years and then stabilize. Confidence: low, because the exact number of cases where immigration status currently alters sentencing is uncertain, enforcement rates vary, and labour replacement can offset much of the output loss. Overall, the bill’s 10‑year cumulative impact is small and likely net negative (~$160–$200M, ≈0.006% of GDP).","This is a narrow criminal‑sentencing change.

C-217,An Act to amend the Canada Student Financial Assistance Act and the Income Tax Act,5,0.04,low,"Affected sectors: post‑secondary education, labour market/human capital, disability services. Mechanism: the bill requires the Minister to pay tuition for students eligible for the Disability Tax Credit (DTC), with payments treated as non‑taxable grants. This effectively reduces direct education costs by roughly $6,000 per year per eligible student (conservative average tuition), increasing enrolment and completions among persons with disabilities and, over time, boosting labour force participation and productivity. Scale: Canada has ~2.0M post‑secondary students; students reporting disabilities are a sizable share, but DTC‑eligible is a narrower subset. Using a conservative baseline of ~45,000 DTC‑eligible students currently enrolled nationwide, a full tuition grant could lift DTC‑eligible enrolment by ~25% (15–30% plausible range given higher price sensitivity), adding ~11,000 incremental FTE students at steady state. Direct output effect in education: incremental 11,000 FTE × $6,000 tuition ≈ $66M/year in additional education services produced; assuming a 2‑year ramp-up, ~8 effective years at/near steady state in the 10-year window ≈ $528M cumulative. Human capital effect: with an average 3‑year program and ~60% completion among incremental entrants, incremental graduates per year at steady state ≈ (11,000/3)*0.60 ≈ 2,200. Within a 10-year window, grads appear from years 4–10; person‑years of higher productivity ≈ 2,200 × (1+2+...+7) = 61,600 person‑years. Assuming a conservative $8,000 annual earnings/productivity premium for a credential among persons with disabilities, cumulative ≈ $493M. Add a modest benefit for non‑completers (partial skill/credentialing, small employment gains) ≈ $50M. Total conservative cumulative GDP addition ≈ $1.07B over 10 years. As a share of ~$2.7T GDP, ≈ 0.04%. Time horizon: enrolment effects start within 1–2 years; earnings/productivity effects materialize mainly in years 4–10.

C-216,An Act to enact the Protection of Minors in the Digital Age Act and to amend two Acts,7,0.012,low,"Affected sectors: social media, online gaming, consumer apps, ad tech, ISPs, and compliance/legal/safety-tech providers. Mechanism: the Act imposes a duty of care for minors, default high-protection settings for children (e.g., disabling autoplay/engagement features), parental controls (default for under-16, including purchase blocking), reliable age verification (privacy-preserving), reporting channels, recordkeeping, biennial independent reviews, and annual transparency reports; it restricts design practices (dark patterns) and tightens online harms/criminal enforcement. Scale: (1) Digital ads: Canada’s digital ad spend ≈ $15B/yr. Minors ~12% of impressions/revenue (~$1.8B), with under-16 ~8% (~$1.2B). Default high-protection/engagement reduction for under-16 likely reduces ad exposure 5–10%; assume 8% → ~$96M/yr less revenue. About 20% of that accrues to Canadian publishers/creators → ~$19M/yr domestic; assume half reallocated to adult/contextual Canadian channels → net domestic -$9.5M/yr (~$95M over 10 years). (2) In-app purchases: default parental controls that can prevent purchases reduce unauthorized minor purchases by a conservative ~$25M/yr; ~40% domestic value added → $10M/yr; assume half reallocated/authorized → net -$5M/yr (~$50M over 10 years). (3) Compliance/safety spend by Canadian operators: ~1,000 Canadian platforms/apps used by minors invest ~$50k setup each (~$50M) plus ~$25k/yr O&M each (~$25M/yr → $250M/10 yrs); independent reviews for ~300 firms at ~$60k every two years (~$90M/10 yrs); ISP reporting/data preservation (~$35M/10 yrs); incremental age-verification/safety-tech services (~$50M/10 yrs). Total domestic compliance/safety-tech spend ≈ $475M over 10 years. Net domestic GDP impact ≈ +$475M - $145M ≈ +$330M over 10 years, or about 0.012% of one year’s GDP ($2.7T). Time horizon: most impacts materialize 18–24 months after royal assent (core duties at 18 months; transparency sections at 24 months), with compliance/adaptation and enforcement ramping over years 2–5 and steady state in years 5–10. Confidence: low due to uncertain enforcement scope, how the CRTC/Minister set guidelines, operator design responses (e.g., global rollouts vs. Canada-specific), the extent of ad budget reallocation to domestic channels, and whether the digital-identifier prohibition is applied only in the context of minors.","Directly relevant to builders operating consumer-facing apps, games, social platforms, or ad tech that minors can access. It creates substantial product, UX, data, and compliance requirements (age verification, default parental controls, disabling engagement features for children, reporting, audits), introduces significant fines and a private right of action, and may alter monetization (ads to minors, in-app purchases). It also generates opportunities for safety-tech, age-estimation, compliance tooling, and legal services. Relevance is not higher (9–10) because impacts are concentrated in child-directed or youth-accessible digital services rather than economy-wide business operations.","Mandates default child-safe design (age verification, parental controls, and reduced engagement features) plus audits/reporting, which increases compliance/safety-tech spending while modestly reducing minor-driven ads and in-app purchases.","Core obligations at 18 months after royal assent; transparency, audits, and CRTC guidelines by 24 months; enforcement/adaptation ramp over years 2–5; steady state by years 5–10.",2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,
C-215,An Act to amend the Marine Liability Act (national strategy respecting pollution caused by shipping container spills),4,0.003,low,"Affected sectors: ocean container carriers, port/terminal operators, marine salvage/spill-response firms, insurers (P&I clubs), coastal tourism, and commercial fisheries/aquaculture; plus environmental monitoring/cleanup tech vendors. Mechanism: the bill mandates a national strategy, independent study, and ongoing reporting, leading to (i) modest new federal procurement for debris monitoring/removal, research, and a multi-party response task force; (ii) small compliance/administrative burdens for carriers and ports (enhanced manifests, spill reporting/communications, coordination drills); and (iii) slightly faster/cheaper response that reduces spill-related closures and cleanup losses. Scale assumptions (conservative): ~1,300 container-ship calls/year in Canada; incremental admin burden ~2–3 staff-hours/call plus training/coordination across carriers/terminals ≈ $6M/year compliance cost (10-year ≈ $60M). Federal strategy implementation outlays for monitoring/cleanup, research, and task-force ops ≈ $10–15M/year; assume $12M average (10-year ≈ $120M) counted as GDP via procurement. Baseline expected spill-related economic losses (cleanup, fishery closures, tourism disruptions) ≈ $7M/year; improved prevention/response yields a 10–15% reduction once mature (avg ~12% during years 3–10) ≈ $9M over 10 years in avoided losses. Net 10-year effect ≈ +$120M (G) − $60M (compliance) + $9M (avoided losses) ≈ +$69M, or ~0.0026% of GDP; rounded to 0.003%. Time horizon: minimal impact in year 1 (study/report), spending/compliance ramp in years 2–3, benefits materialize years 3–10. Confidence: low, because the bill does not specify funding levels or binding regulatory changes, and outcomes depend on future strategy content, intergovernmental coordination, and whether any compensation fund is later created.","Some relevance for a narrow set of builders/entrepreneurs in marine logistics, ports, spill response, coastal cleanup tech, and environmental services (potential procurement and partnership opportunities). For most businesses, effects are indirect and small; the bill is largely a planning/coordination mandate without new market-wide rules, taxes, or funding streams.

C-213,An Act to amend the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (cessation of refugee protection),4,0.009,low,"Affected sectors: general labour market across services, construction, manufacturing, caregiving, and hospitality; plus legal/administrative (IRB/CBSA) caseloads. Mechanism: by repealing provisions that strip permanent resident (PR) status when refugee protection ceases, the bill prevents removals of PRs who would otherwise be deported on cessation grounds. This (1) retains workers and human capital in Canada, (2) reduces employer turnover and vacancy costs, and (3) lowers IRB/CBSA investigation, hearing, and removal enforcement costs. Scale: publicly available trends suggest cessation-driven PR status loss/removal happens to a small number of people annually (order of hundreds, not thousands). Conservative baseline used here: 120 PR removals avoided per year (range 50–300). Assume 60% employment among affected adults and $50,000 GDP per employed worker for this cohort. Time horizon and calculation: retained-workers GDP over 10 years accumulates by cohort: 120 removals/year × 60% employed × $50,000 per worker × (10+9+...+1 = 55) ≈ $198M. Administrative/fiscal savings: assume ~250 fewer PR-related cessation cases per year at ~$8,000 per case in investigation/hearing costs ≈ $2.0M/year → $20M over 10 years; avoided removal enforcement averaging $10,000 per prevented removal × 120/year ≈ $1.2M/year → $12M over 10 years. Employer turnover savings: if ~72 employed persons/year would otherwise be removed (60% of 120) and replacement/friction costs average $4,000, that is ~$0.288M/year → ~$2.9M over 10 years. Total 10-year cumulative impact ≈ $198M + $20M + $12M + $2.9M ≈ $233M, or about 0.009% of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP. Sensitivity: if actual avoided removals are closer to 300/year, the 10-year cumulative effect rises toward ~$600M–$1B (≈0.02%–0.04%). Implementation barriers: minimal—federal statute change applies immediately, though CBSA/IRB practice may take months to adjust. Confidence: low, because precise annual counts of PRs losing status due to cessation and cost-per-case vary and are not publicly consolidated; however, even wide variance keeps the impact in the negligible-to-minor band.","Some relevance to builders and entrepreneurs via labour stability and reduced turnover risk for a small group of employees who are PRs with refugee backgrounds. Also marginal reduction in administrative uncertainty for employers. However, the affected population is small and the bill does not change overall immigration levels, business regulation, or capital formation, so direct business implications are limited.","Prevents loss of permanent resident status and removals due to cessation of refugee protection, retaining a small number of workers annually and reducing IRB/CBSA cessation caseload and removal costs.",Immediate to 2 years: legal effect on Royal Assent; IRB/CBSA practice shifts within months; workforce retention and administrative savings accumulate over 10 years.,2025-10-17T23:43:56.865Z,

C-8,"An Act respecting cyber security, amending the Telecommunications Act and making consequential amendments to other Acts",7,0.09,low,"Affected sectors: federally regulated critical infrastructure — telecommunications, banking and financial market infrastructures (clearing and settlement), interprovincial pipelines and high-voltage lines, nuclear energy systems, and federally regulated transportation (air, rail, marine). Mechanism: the bill (1) mandates cybersecurity programs, supply‑chain/third‑party risk mitigation, and 72‑hour incident reporting for designated operators; (2) empowers ministers to direct operators to restrict/remove high‑risk vendors or implement specified controls; and (3) introduces audits, inspections and administrative monetary penalties that raise compliance and enforcement certainty. Scale and conservative quantification (10‑year, CAD): (a) Compliance OPEX: assume ~90 designated operators across sectors (large telcos, D‑SIB banks/FMIs, major pipelines/rail/air, nuclear). Incremental program + reporting cost averages ~$3M/operator/year => ~$270M/year. Assume 60% domestic value add (staff, Canadian integrators/consultants) => ~$162M/year added to GDP; over 10 years ≈ $1.62B. (b) Hardening/CapEx and supplier risk mitigation: incremental ~$1.0B spread over 10 years (network segmentation, backups, monitoring, limited vendor replacement). Assume 40% domestic value add => ~$0.4B to GDP over 10 years. (c) Avoided outages and productivity losses: baseline national‑scale outages (telecom/payments) are rare but costly (hundreds of millions). Conservatively assume one such event every 5 years costing ~$0.3–0.6B; a 20% reduction in frequency/severity from the bill’s controls yields ~$0.2B expected avoided loss over 10 years. Add smaller incidents across operators (~$100M/year aggregate losses); 15% reduction => ~$0.15B over 10 years. Total avoided losses ≈ $0.35B. Net 10‑year GDP effect ≈ $1.62B (OPEX) + $0.4B (CapEx) + $0.35B (avoided losses) = ~$2.37B ≈ 0.09% of Canada’s ~$2.7T GDP. Offsets/risks: ministerial orders could force additional supplier removals with low domestic value add, and transition work could cause temporary service disruptions; implementation depends on regulations and class designations. Given tail‑risk uncertainty and regulatory timing, confidence is low.","Directly relevant for builders selling cybersecurity, compliance, telecom/network equipment, and managed services to critical infrastructure operators; it will drive new spend, audits, vendor qualifications, and third‑party risk requirements that cascade to suppliers.

C-7,"An Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money for the federal public administration for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026",4,0.009,medium,"This is a routine supply bill authorizing $8.58B in Supplementary Estimates (A) for FY2025–26, mostly to National Defence ($8.21B) and the Communications Security Establishment ($0.37B). Because Supplementary Estimates largely fund previously planned operations rather than new policy, most of this spending would occur via other appropriations if this bill did not pass. Conservatively assuming only 5% is truly incremental vs baseline approvals, 60% domestic value-added (wages/services) and 80% spent in-year yields ~$0.206B direct GDP (8.58*0.05*0.6*0.8). Applying a modest 1.2 multiplier implies ~$0.247B total effect, or ~0.009% of GDP ($0.247B / $2.7T). As a one‑year injection with minimal persistence, the 10‑year cumulative impact remains in the negligible band (<0.01%). The bill also contains standard multi‑year commitment authority for Defence, but payments still require future appropriations, so we treat it as non-incremental to the 10‑year baseline.","Somewhat relevant primarily to defence and cybersecurity contractors and suppliers (potential contracts, grants, and operating spend).

It does not change tax policy or introduce new multi‑year programs, so incremental GDP effects versus the baseline budget are negligible. Still, timely authorization has small real effects by avoiding procurement/grant delays. Affected sectors: construction/infrastructure (Public Works, Transport, DND capital, Windsor‑Detroit Bridge), housing developers and CMHC program recipients, IT/cyber (Shared Services, CSE), defense/aerospace, R&D (NRC, NSERC, CIHR), logistics and transport (CATSA, VIA, Marine Atlantic). Mechanism: prevents stop‑work/payment delays on contracts and contributions, and reduces working‑capital costs and remobilization/cancellation friction. Scale: of the $149.8B authorized, a conservative ~35% (~$52B) flows to private‑sector vendors and contribution recipients via operating procurement, capital, and grants. Avoiding an average 10‑day delay in disbursements saves ~0.164% financing cost (6% annual x 10/365) on ~$52B ≈ $85M. Add a one‑time 0.1% friction avoided on roughly $15B of capital‑heavy items (DND/Public Works/Transport/Housing) ≈ $15M. Include shutdown risk option value: assume a low 2% probability of a 1‑month halt affecting ~30% of vendor‑facing spend (~$15.6B), with 5% not recovered within the decade ⇒ expected loss avoided ≈ $15.6M.

C-211,An Act to amend the Income Tax Act and the Canada Pension Plan (deeming provision),4,0.03,low,"Affected sectors: households with disabilities (direct), retail/consumer-facing businesses (induced demand), financial services administering RDSPs, and public administration/health paperwork (administrative burden). Mechanism: the bill deems individuals who qualify for provincial disability benefits/credits as eligible for the federal Disability Tax Credit (DTC) and CPP-Disability (CPP-D), reducing duplicate applications and increasing federal program uptake. This raises disposable income for disabled individuals/caregivers and modestly lowers compliance costs. Scale (conservative): incremental CPP-D recipients averaging ~6,000 over the period at ~$13,000/year ≈ $78M/year; incremental DTC claimants ~50,000 with realized average federal tax reduction ~$900 ≈ $45M/year; incremental RDSP grants/bonds ≈ $10M/year; total additional disposable income ≈ $133M/year. Transfers do not directly increase GDP, but higher disposable income likely raises consumption. Using MPC ≈ 0.9 and a modest multiplier ≈ 0.8, implied GDP effect ≈ $133M × 0.72 ≈ $96M/year (~0.0035% of $2.7T GDP). Allowing a 10–15% offset for possible marginal labor-supply effects and implementation frictions yields ~0.003% per year. Over 10 years, cumulative impact ≈ 0.03% of GDP. Time horizon: DTC changes apply to 2026+ tax years; CPP-D deeming would phase in after regulations/data-sharing are in place; main impacts materialize in 2–5 years and persist thereafter.
