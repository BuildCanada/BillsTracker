Meeting the Moment, Building Canada Strong
The world is changing, profoundly and in real time; we are no longer living in an era of
calm, but of significant change. The nexus between energy security, economic security, and
national security is clearer than ever before.
The systems that long underpinned our prosperity and enabled decades of economic
growth—stable global trade alliances, predictable supply chains, a cooperative international
order, and reliable partnerships—are being redrawn and constantly challenged.
What we are contending with is not a transition, it’s a generational shift. One that challenges
our assumptions, tests our institutions, and demands a fundamentally different response—
not one of caution, but of courage. Not one of passive stewardship, but of active, ambitious
nation-building.
This is the context for Budget 2025.
Just as Canadians mobilised in the 1940s to defend freedom and rebuild the global economy,
and just as we restored fiscal sustainability in the 1990s to secure future growth, today we
stand at another crossroads. A new era of disruption demands a new era of leadership—and a
new economic foundation built on resilience, sovereignty, and innovation.
Canada is ready. Because Canada is strong.
We are rich in natural resources—critical minerals, clean and conventional power, and
endowed with a world-class agri-food industry that give Canada a real competitive
advantage. We are powered by a skilled and diverse workforce, home to leading researchers,
entrepreneurs, and innovators. We have one of the strongest fiscal foundations in the G7,
and well-established stability and democratic values.
Budget 2025 is our plan to harness these strengths and meet the moment. It is our roadmap
to spend less so we can invest more.
It lays out a generational investment strategy—to supercharge growth and build a clean
electricity grid, unlock the full value of our critical minerals, accelerate housing construction,
and drive innovation in sectors like artificial intelligence, life sciences, and advanced
manufacturing, the kind of investments that will restore growth.
It is a strategy to build at a speed, scope, and scale not seen in generations. With Canadian
workers at the centre, and the national interest at the heart of every decision.
It is also a blueprint to defend our sovereignty—through historic investments in national
defence, security, and the capabilities we need to protect Canadians in an increasingly
fractured world.
And it is grounded in fiscal responsibility. Because leadership means making smart, strategic
investments—while preserving the strength that comes from having the lowest net debt-to-
GDP ratio of the G7, a strong fiscal position, and a clear path to long-term sustainability.
Among the G7, Canada is being recognised as one of the few advanced economies with the
fiscal space and discipline to invest in its future.

As the International Monetary Fund Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, recently
said, “Canada stands out in the G7… The Canadian authorities have been very decisive to
take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner. One of
these actions is to modernise the budget framework—separating operating spending from
investing, and focusing strategically on pro-growth investments that can lift up productivity…
in areas like housing, infrastructure, and energy—Canada is making the right choices.”
This is not a time for small plans. It is a time for clear vision and decisive action.
Budget 2025 reflects a simple but powerful truth: Canada has what the world needs and
increasingly wants—and importantly what this moment demands. The work ahead will not
be easy, but we have faced defining challenges before. We overcame them—and emerged
stronger. We will do so again.
Let us meet this moment. Let us build a Canada that is confident, secure, and resilient—
for today, and for generations to come.
Now is the time to build Canada Strong.

Global Generational Shifts
The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen
since the fall of the Berlin Wall. The rules-based international order and the trading system that
powered Canada’s prosperity for decades are being reshaped—threatening our sovereignty,
our prosperity, and our values. Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once
ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products are being disrupted. In the process
we must redefine Canada’s international, commercial, and security relationships.
This is not a transition. It is a rupture—a generational shift taking place over a short period of time.
This new reality is reshaping Canada’s economic foundations.
Current Economic Challenges
All advanced economies are feeling global economic challenges, and Canada is no different.
With the historic rise in tariffs posing significant challenges to the Canadian economy,
Canadians are feeling the impact in their daily lives:
• 	The cost of living remains high, putting financial pressure on families and small businesses.
• 	Unemployment has increased, driven by weak hiring and layoffs in trade-exposed sectors
such as manufacturing.
• 	Businesses face ongoing uncertainty, delaying investment and expansion, as in other
G7 countries.
• 	Global economic growth has slowed, with real GDP in advanced economies expected to grow
1.6 per cent in 2025 and 2026.
• 	Productivity remains weak, limiting wage gains for workers.
• 	Oil prices are lower and volatile, adding pressure on exports and revenues.
Canada’s new government is responding. Canada is being recognised for our approach to
navigating these global challenges. The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund,
Kristalina Georgieva, acknowledged that “both Germany and Canada recognise that in this very
testing time, they need to use their fiscal space. In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities
have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main
trading partner.”
These generational challenges are raising threats to our long-term prosperity. Budget 2025
is Canada’s new government’s plan to address these challenges from a position of strength,
determination, and ambition.
In times of great change, Canadians have always been able to adapt, transform, and seize
opportunities. Canada has what the world needs. We are an energy superpower in clean and
conventional energy, among the top five producers of the most important critical minerals, and a
leading developer of artificial intelligence. We have the resources and people we need to thrive
and compete in today’s global economy. And Canada has the confidence to seize this moment.
This is our time to build Canada Strong.

The global trade landscape is changing rapidly, as the United States reshapes its economic
relationships and supply chains around the world. The impact is profound—hurting Canadian
companies, displacing workers, disrupting supply chains, and creating uncertainty that holds
back investment. This level of uncertainty is greater than what we have seen in recent crises.
Meeting the challenge in an uncertain world
The unprecedented level of uncertainty is weighing on economic growth.

Canada can achieve its ambition
As we face these challenges, Canada’s new government is acting decisively. We will protect
and transform our strategic industries, build a stronger economy, and invest in ourselves.
Budget 2025 makes generational investments while maintaining Canada’s strong fiscal
advantage—a foundation that allows us to invest ambitiously and responsibly, and build
Canada’s economy to be the strongest in the G7.
Our Canadian Advantage
Despite challenges, Canada remains strong and has what the world wants:
• 	Talent: a skilled, educated, and adaptable workforce.
• 	Resources: critical minerals, clean and conventional energy, and agri-food.
• 	Market access: the only country in the G7 to have free-trade agreements with all
the other G7 countries.
• 	Resilience: a strong social safety net and stable institutions.
• 	Rule of law: a robust and reliable financial system, an independent judiciary, and
transparent governments.
• 	Investment attractiveness: a favourable environment for foreign investments that grows
our economy and creates high-paying careers.
• 	Tax competitiveness: lowest overall tax burden in the G7 on new business investment.
Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7 and one of the smallest deficit-to-GDP
ratios in the G7. Canada and Germany are the only two G7 economies rated AAA, a marker of
strong investor confidence which helps keep our borrowing costs as low as possible.

Our Plan to
Build, Protect, and Empower Canada
Canada has what the world wants. We have everything we need to prosper in this global
generational shift. We have the workers, the industries, and the resources to compete and
thrive in the global economy. We can create more for ourselves than can ever be taken
away. We will bet on Canada’s innovators and builders, with a plan that will supercharge the
growth of our economy by crowding-in hundreds of billions of dollars of new investment.
We will unite in solidarity around our own unique identity, history, and geography by
protecting our culture, nature, official languages, and core values. We will build in true
partnership with Indigenous Peoples.
This is our moment. Our time to make generational investments.
Our plan is clear—we will focus and deliver on these priorities:
12
-- 22 of 493 --

Spending less to invest more
Canada’s new government is changing how government works—spending less on operations
so we can invest more in Canada’s future: creating high-paying careers, building our country,
and growing our economy.
Government itself must become much more productive by rightsizing, cutting red tape and
wasteful spending, and adopting AI at scale. By doing so, we will focus on results and use
scarce tax dollars to catalyse private investment.
Budget 2025 introduces a new approach to fiscal discipline and strategic investment.
Our ambitious savings plan means Canadians can count on their government to be more
efficient in delivering services that matter—while reducing operational costs. In fact, we are
slowing growth in direct program spending from 8 per cent to under 1 per cent.
Capital investments, historical and projected
We will make capital investments a national priority to build Canada Strong.
For years prior to 2024-25, ongoing capital investments and identifiable precursor programs are included.
The government is introducing a capital budgeting framework to modernise our approach and
deliver generational investments. This framework clearly distinguishes day-to-day operational
spending from long-term investments that strengthen our economy—changing the architecture
of government fiscal planning to deliver greater investment and growth for Canadians.

INTRODUCTION 13
-- 23 of 493 --

Concurrently, the government has changed the budgetary cycle to fall budgets—supporting
better planning for provinces and territories, municipalities, builders, and investors, and
aligning with the construction season. Combined, these two changes mark a new era in how we
plan and deliver—catalysing generational investments that empower Canadians.
We are also transforming how government works. A new Office of Digital Transformation will
lead the adoption of AI and other new technologies across government. This, coupled with near-
term procurement of made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools for the public service, means not just
a more efficient government, but also a generational opportunity for our domestic innovators.
The result is more taxpayer dollars will go toward nation-building infrastructure, clean energy,
innovation, productivity, and less on day-to-day operating spending. This new discipline will
allow us to protect social benefits. Rightsizing government is critical to realigning resources to
enable generational investments that strengthen Canada’s future.
This plan rests on two fiscal anchors:
• 	Balancing day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29,
shifting spending toward investments that grow the economy; and
• 	Maintaining a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio to ensure disciplined fiscal
management for future generations.
In addition to these anchors, Budget 2025 enables $1 trillion in total investment over
the next five years through smarter public spending and stronger capital investment.

Comprehensive Expenditure Review
Budget 2025 delivers on the Comprehensive Expenditure Review—reducing inefficiency and
focusing on core priorities.
$60B
in savings over 5 years
The Comprehensive Expenditure Review will rein in government spending—saving Canada
$13 billion annually by 2028-29, for a total with other savings and revenues of $60 billion over
five years. The responsible choices we are making allow us to spend less to invest more in the
workers, businesses, and nation-building infrastructure that will build Canada Strong.
Savings will be achieved by restructuring operations and consolidating internal services and
rightsizing programs to realise efficiencies. It will also involve workforce adjustment and
attrition to return the size of the public service to a more sustainable level.
The government understands that transitions can be difficult and is committed to minimising
hardship for federal employees, while also protecting diversity in the public service
workforce and ensuring a strong, younger generation of public servants.
This is a transformational time for the public service to revisit how we work, how we can
improve services to Canadians, and how we can build for the future. A leaner public service
is a more empowered and productive public service.
We will also take action to close tax loopholes and make sure everyone is paying their fair share.

Public Service versus Canadian Population Growth – 2019 to 2029
Since 2019, the public service has grown at an unprecedented rate. Through
actions like the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, public service growth will
be brought in line with forecasted Canadian population growth.
Sources: Statistics Canada; Treasury Board Secretariat; Department of Finance Canada calculations.
Notes: Annual public service population figures are as at March 31. Annual Canadian population figures are as at July
1, with estimates beyond 2024 based on Statistics Canada’s M1 projection.
Spending less on government and more on Canada
Over the next four years, capital investments that grow the economy as well as
major transfers to people, provinces, and territories will rise, but other direct
program expenses will fall.
Compound Annual Growth Rate between 2025-26 and 2029-30.
These actions require us to make necessary, responsible decisions to balance our day-to-day operating
spending by 2028-2029 and deliver on our priorities while staying true to Canadians’ values.

Our Generational Investments
To meet the challenges of our time and seize new opportunities, we must make generational
investments that protect and transform our industries, strengthen our economy, and
empower Canadians.
Canada stands at a crossroads. This is the moment to move from reliance to resilience.
The global shocks we have endured demand more than short-term fixes; they call for a bold
down payment on the prosperity of the next generation. This government is here to get big
things done for Canadians, at a scale and speed not seen in generations.
Our generational investments in housing,
infrastructure, defence, and productivity and
competitiveness will allow us to meet the moment.

Building Canada Strong
An Economy by Canadians, for Canadians
We cannot control what other nations do. But we can control what we build for ourselves.
Canada is building the strongest economy in the G7, transforming it from reliance to resilience.
In the face of uncertainty around the world, we are ensuring that our workers and businesses
will prosper by building Canada’s strength at home, an economy for Canadians, by Canadians.
This new government is building One Canadian Economy turbo-charged by major nation-
building projects that will connect our regions, diversify our markets, and create hundreds of
thousands of high-paying careers, from the skilled trades to advanced technology.
Canada must build an enormous amount of infrastructure at speeds and scale not seen
in generations.
This includes the infrastructure to diversify our trading relationships, to become an energy
superpower in both clean and conventional energies, to restore affordability to housing, and to
secure our borders and our communities.
Just as the railways united our country, the Trans-Canada Highway opened our frontiers,
and the St. Lawrence Seaway linked our economy to the world, today’s projects will be as
transformative—building clean power grids for a sustainable future, expanding our ports to
accelerate our trade, and unlocking the full potential of Canada’s critical minerals.
INTRODUCTION 19
-- 29 of 493 --

We are strengthening the economic foundations of our nation, giving our workers, innovators,
and businesses the tools they need to compete, create, and lead in a changing world.
• 	Fast-tracking nation-building projects: In close partnership with provinces, territories,
Indigenous Peoples, and private investors the government is streamlining regulatory
approvals and helping to structure financing.
• 	Competing and winning abroad: To seize new opportunities in a changing world, Canada is
launching a new Trade Diversification Strategy to boost our global footprint. Building on
our world-class agreements and partnerships, this strategy will double overseas exports
over a decade, generating $300 billion more in trade. Through a new Trade Diversification
Corridors Fund, we will improve access to overseas markets by investing in new port,
airport, and railway infrastructure. And we are providing Canadian businesses with the tools
and expertise they need to succeed abroad. Canada will be a fast, reliable, and indispensable
global partner.
• 	Becoming our own best customer: Our new Buy Canadian Policy will ensure
public dollars will be used to strengthen our supply chains, and support homegrown
innovation. When the government spends, we will select Canadian suppliers by default,
wherever possible. By launching our Defence Industrial Strategy, we will grow our defence
sector, increasing the capacity and competitiveness of homegrown defence suppliers.
• 	Investing in defence and security: Our government is making a generational investment
in defence that will create good, high-paying careers for Canadians, and strengthen our
economy and collective resilience.
• 	Driving growth and innovation: Our government will make it cheaper for Canadian
companies to invest through a new productivity super-deduction. We will invest in
AI projects to further the technology’s adoption at home, and catalyse private sector
investment in Canada’s most innovative startups. The government is also developing a
new AI strategy, and will consider whether new AI incentives and supports should be
provided. We are creating the right conditions for real, sustainable growth.
• 	Powering a clean economy: Through Canada’s new Climate Competitiveness Strategy, we
are strengthening Canadian leadership in a low-carbon economy. With the Clean Economy
Investment Tax Credits, we will supercharge affordable, net-zero energy projects that turn our
natural wealth into lasting prosperity while protecting the planet. Canada will build for the
future, leveraging nuclear, solar, wind, clean hydrogen, and other renewable energy.
• 	Protecting our strength: A Strategic Response Fund to realign producers to serve the
Canadian market and reach new markets globally, coupled with a major reskilling effort,
will help tens of thousands of workers and key sectors—from canola to lumber to steel and
aluminum and our auto sector—stay competitive and resilient in a shifting global economy.
This is how we ensure Canada thrives in an uncertain world.

Empowering Canadians:
A core mission of Canada’s new government is to empower Canadians by building our
economic strength. We are making decisions that empower Canadians with better careers,
lower costs, and more choices so you can build the future you want.
From the beginning of our mandate, Canada’s new government has been relentlessly focused
on bringing down costs for Canadians. The government is delivering tax cuts to the middle
class and first-time home buyers, and has brought down prices at the gas pump.
By lowering costs, the government is building an economy where every Canadian can seize
new opportunities and can take control of their own future.
When Canadians empower each other, everyone benefits, and Canada prospers.
By supercharging homebuilding
Canada is facing a steep housing supply gap. One that threatens affordability, opportunity,
and the ability for Canadians to build a life and a future here at home.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation estimates that to restore affordability
to 2019 levels, homebuilding must nearly double from its current pace of around 280,000
homes per year to between 430,000 and 480,000 homes per year over the next decade. The
Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates 290,000 homes per year would be needed to close
the supply gap.
Canadians demand immediate action, and this government is delivering with the urgency that this
moment requires—with bold action to unlock supply and bring affordability back within reach.
From eliminating the GST for first-time buyers on homes at or under $1 million, to launching
Build Canada Homes—a new federal agency that will drive investment and public-private
cooperation—we will build faster and smarter.
Federal dollars invested in Build Canada Homes will be leveraged to attract private capital,
investors, and builders to expand the housing supply. We are putting the conditions in place
to catalyse maximum investment while mainstreaming advanced methods of construction,
with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50 per cent, reduce costs by as much
as 20 per cent, and lower emissions by approximately 20 per cent during construction. With
this, Canada can significantly increase its supply of affordable homes and become a global
leader in housing innovation, including in construction techniques, sustainable materials, and
leading-edge manufacturing.

By bringing down costs for Canadians
Budget 2025 will spend less on government operations and cut waste, so we can invest more
in growing our economy and protecting essential programs that make life more affordable.
Our new government has been focused on bringing down costs and creating new
opportunities for Canadians. We have:
• 	Cancelled the divisive consumer carbon price, cutting gas prices by approximately
18¢ per litre in most provinces and territories.
• 	Cut taxes for 22 million middle-class Canadians, saving a two-income family up to
$840 per year.
• 	Created opportunities for young Canadians to transition into the workforce and
launch successful careers, by launching a Youth Climate Corps, and providing
175,000 placements through Canada Summer Jobs, the horizontal Youth Employment
and Skills Strategy, and the Student Work Placement Program in 2026-27.
• 	Made the National School Food Program permanent to provide meals to up to 400,000
children every year, allowing participating families with two children to save an average of
$800 per year.
• 	Begun the process to launch Automatic Federal Benefits that will reach up to 5.5 million
low-income Canadians for the 2028 tax year to ensure everyone who deserves benefits
receives them.
• 	Renewed the Canada Strong Pass, helping families and young people travel and
explore Canada for less.
• 	Reduced Confederation Bridge and interprovincial ferry fares in Atlantic Canada—
leading to a 25 per cent increase in usage of these services for visitors leaving Prince
Edward Island in August, compared with the previous year.
• 	Upheld the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
decision to expand wholesale access, boosting competition and lowering Internet
costs for Canadians.
A more affordable Canada also means a more competitive one. Budget 2025 will include
early, but meaningful, measures to increase competition and drive down costs in key sectors
such as telecommunications and banking. Our government will continue to push for more
choice for Canadians across the economy.
Our government remains focused on empowering Canadians—by lowering costs, expanding
opportunity, and protecting the vital social programs Canadians rely on, from child care to
dental care to pharmacare.

Protecting Canada:
By Ensuring Safety for all Canadians
In a world that is growing more unpredictable, Canada can count on being one of the
safest countries in the world. But more must be done. We must be ready to take a
stronger approach in the face of increasingly sophisticated crimes to protect our people,
our communities, and our economy.
That means reinforcing our borders, cracking down on organised crime and illegal trafficking,
and protecting Canadians across the country so you can live, work, and worship in peace.
Canada’s new government is taking decisive action to keep Canadians safe:
• 	Through Canada’s $1.3 billion Border Plan—an unprecedented investment in our borders—
and new investments in Budget 2025, we are hiring 1,000 new Canada Border Services
Agency officers, modernising border technology, and strengthening intelligence-sharing to
stop illegal guns, drugs, and human smuggling before they reach our streets.
• 	We are also hiring 1,000 new RCMP personnel to expand policing capacity and
strengthen federal enforcement where Canadians need it most—from suppressing
gun and drug trafficking and disrupting money-laundering networks, to boosting
investigative capacity against professional enablers of organised crime.
• 	As fraud becomes more sophisticated and impacts more Canadians, especially seniors
and newcomers, we are launching a National Anti-Fraud Strategy to implement stronger
protections for consumers.
• 	We are creating a new Financial Crimes Agency that will be Canada’s lead enforcement
agency on complex financial crimes. It will bring together the expertise necessary to
investigate money laundering, fraud, and online financial scams.
• 	Our government has launched an ambitious bail reform strategy to ensure that
Canadians are safe in their communities. This includes making bail laws stricter and
sentencing laws tougher for repeat and violent offending, to support the front lines and
to invest in long-term prevention.
This is how we protect our sovereignty
at home and keep Canadians safe.
26
-- 36 of 493 --

By Defending our Sovereignty and Security
In an increasingly dangerous and divided world, Canada must be ready to defend our people
and values, to secure our sovereignty, and to stand as a strong, reliable partner with our allies.
Budget 2025 delivers on that commitment with a generational investment in our capacity to
strengthen and protect our sovereignty and security. Canada’s new government is rebuilding,
rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), ensuring our military has the
personnel, equipment, training, and infrastructure it needs to protect Canadians and lead
abroad. This includes the most significant pay increase for the CAF in a generation, and
major investments to support the health needs of CAF members.
Canada will meet the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) 2 per cent defence-spending
target this year—five years ahead of schedule—and accelerate investments in the years ahead
to put Canada on a path to meeting NATO’s 5 per cent Defence Investment Pledge by 2035.
Our renewed commitment to defence will create good, high-paying careers for Canadian workers
and drive investments that strengthen our economic, infrastructure, and collective resilience.
To that end, we are creating a new Defence Investment Agency and making significant
progress on a Defence Industrial Strategy to rebuild domestic production capacity and
strengthen our supply chains.
These investments will modernise our fleets, expand Arctic and maritime surveillance, bolster cyber
and space capabilities, and create high-paying careers for Canadian workers across the country.

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 29
Economic and Fiscal Overview
A Changing World, A New Opportunity
The global economy is undergoing a profound transformation. After decades in
which globalisation and free trade underpinned growth, a fundamental shift is
now underway—driven by economic nationalism, geopolitical uncertainty, and
rapid technological change.
Major global events—from financial crises and pandemics to de-industrialisation
and rising geopolitical tensions—have challenged long-standing institutions and
the rules-based international system. Many countries are now placing greater
emphasis on domestic resilience, including through policies aimed at securing
critical sectors and supply chains.
Industrial policy, once seen as secondary to market forces, is returning to the
forefront. In 2024 alone, governments worldwide introduced more than 2,500
industrial policy measures reflecting a transition in how governments are
protecting national security interests and securing long-term competitiveness.
The United States, our largest trading partner, is fundamentally reshaping all of its
trading relationships and putting up trade barriers, with its average tariffs across
all countries rising from around 2 per cent at the end of 2024 to 17 per cent
today. The effect is profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting
supply chains, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.
This evolving global context is creating significant uncertainties for firms
navigating investment and supply chain decisions in North America and across
the world—precisely when Canada needs investment to build its future.
A Pivotal Moment for Canada’s Economy
For a country like Canada—where about one-third of national income comes
from exports—these global shifts carry significant implications.
Canada’s trade relationships within North America remain central to its
economy, but their nature is changing. New tariffs and shifting trade policies are
straining supply chains and raising costs for Canadian exporters:
-- 39 of 493 --

30
• 	High tariffs and significant trade actions now apply to key exports to our
largest trading partner, including autos, steel, aluminum, copper, softwood
lumber, and wood products. A 35 per cent tariff also applies to non-
Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) compliant goods.
• 	Canadian agricultural exporters are also facing higher Chinese tariffs on
canola, pork, and seafood.
• 	Tariff levels continue to shift, and uncertainty about future trade policy is
elevated.
Despite these pressures, Canada continues to benefit from favourable access to
our largest export market.
• 	Canada has the best deal across all key U.S. trading partners, with
85 per cent of Canada-U.S. trade remaining tariff-free.
• 	The average U.S. tariff rate on Canadian goods stands at 5.4 per cent—the
lowest among all major countries trading with the U.S. (Chart 1).1

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 31
The economic strategy of the United States is shifting from a commitment to
multilateral trade liberalisation to more transactional and managed bilateral
trade and investment. The economic effects on the Canadian economy are
already evident:
• 	New tariffs, and the uncertainty caused by trade tensions, are weighing on
exports, curbing business investment, and contributing to a broader
slowdown in economic activity. The Canadian economy expanded by just
0.2 per cent in the first half of the year.
• 	Labour markets are showing signs of strain, with trade tensions interrupting
the recovery that had been underway since mid-2024. Although the
economy has continued to create jobs, the unemployment rate rose from
6.6 per cent in February to 7.1 per cent in September (Chart 2), with trade-
exposed industries and regions most affected.
• 	The medium-term outlook has weakened. Real GDP is now projected to
grow just above 1 per cent annually in 2025 and 2026 compared to
projections of about 2 per cent in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement (FES
2024) (Chart 3). This is a risk that the economy is adjusting to a
persistently lower growth trajectory—marked by weaker productivity and
soft investment.

These developments have also brought long-standing structural challenges into
sharper focus: weak productivity, chronically low business investment, overreliance
on U.S. demand, and internal barriers that fragment the Canadian market.
To support workers and businesses affected by new tariffs and trade tensions, the
government has provided targeted sectoral measures, including re-training,
income supports for workers, and liquidity, investment, and procurement supports
for businesses. This immediate support is necessary, but not the entire solution.
While external forces will continue to shape the global economy, Canada retains
the ability to chart its own economic course. By strengthening resilience,
fostering innovation, and enhancing competitiveness, Canada can better
withstand global shocks, seize new opportunities, and secure lasting prosperity
for Canadians.
Building Canada’s Future Economy
Budget 2025 is our plan to build the strongest economy in the G7 and one that
empowers Canadians to get ahead. It focuses on building our strength at home
to ensure Canada does not just withstand global shifts but prospers from them.
Both Germany and Canada recognise that in this very testing time, they need
to use their fiscal space. In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have
been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with
their main trading partner. And one of these actions is indeed to reform—
modernise the budget framework by (…) separating operating expenses in the
budget from investment—that ability to then focus strategically on investment
that are pro-growth, that can lift up productivity. The areas that
Canada identified, housing, infrastructure, energy, they are thinking of some
strategic projects. These are areas that we see the need of doing more so
Canada can lift up productivity.
— Kristalina Georgieva, International Monetary Fund Managing
Director, Annual Meetings 2025
-- 42 of 493 --

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 33
At its core, our plan is a long-term economic strategy that is anchored on
four objectives:
• 	Harnessing Our Strengths: Canada has what the world wants—it is an
energy superpower in clean and conventional energy, among the top five
producers of the world’s most important critical minerals, a leading
developer of artificial intelligence and quantum, has a highly educated
workforce, and the ability to attract top talent from around the world.
Investments in these foundations, including major nation-building projects,
will spur growth of our industries and help businesses thrive in today’s
global economy.
• 	Building Our Nation: Canada’s new government is investing to build major
nation-building projects that are in our national interest. These projects will
connect our regional economies to each other and to the world. Build
Canada Homes will help double the pace of construction to build millions of
more homes. As we build our nation, we are creating high-paying careers
and supporting Canadian industries such as steel, aluminum, critical
minerals, and softwood lumber, with our Buy Canadian Policy. It’s time to
build big, build bold, and build now.
• 	Unifying Our Economy: Becoming our own best customer requires a more
integrated domestic market. The One Canadian Economy Act helps break
down internal trade and labour barriers, which cost Canadians as much as
$200 billion in lost opportunities a year. The Act expedites nation-building
projects, and unleashes economic growth, with Indigenous partnerships
and inclusion at the centre of this approach. Building one Canadian
economy will create, and connect Canadians to, high-paying careers and
more prosperity.
• 	Diversifying Our Trade: We are developing a more flexible, resilient
network of partners. Canada’s new Trade Diversification Strategy will
strengthen existing relationships and open new markets for Canadian
businesses, particularly in Asia. Our investments in trade infrastructure will
increase Canada’s trade capacity. Through the Major Projects Office, we are
also helping to develop transformative energy and trade corridors. This
includes the Port of Churchill Plus project, that has the potential to expand
export capacity in the North through Hudson Bay—increasing and
diversifying trade with Europe and other partners, while more strongly
linking Churchill, Manitoba to the rest of Canada.
-- 43 of 493 --

34
To support our plan to build a stronger economy, the government is adopting a
new growth-oriented approach to its budget—underscored by the shift in the
composition of spending. This new approach is guided by two fiscal anchors:
1. Balancing day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028–29,
shifting spending toward investments that grow the economy; and
2. Maintaining a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio to ensure disciplined fiscal
management for future generations.
In addition to these anchors, Budget 2025 enables $1 trillion in total investment
over the next five years through smarter public spending and stronger capital
investment.
The economic impact of achieving this target would be substantial,
compounding over time through higher productivity. As an illustration, with
$500 billion in additional private investment over 5 years, real GDP could be
about 3.5 per cent higher than otherwise by 2030, reflecting the enduring
benefits of a more capital-rich economy. Over the same period, Canadians’
purchasing power would strengthen, with real GDP per capita $1,400 higher per
year, on average. This lift in output could improve the budgetary balance by an
average of $7 billion per year over the forecast horizon.
1. Global Context
Slower Global Growth and Rising Risks
Global economic growth has been solid over the last two years. Inflation in most
advanced economies has fallen and given central banks, in Canada or elsewhere,
the room to pause or cut interest rates, supporting household spending and
business investment.
This year, risks to growth and inflation have risen. In particular, average U.S.
tariffs are at levels not seen in decades (Chart 4), making trade more expensive
and unpredictable. These trade measures are reshaping global trade and
straining global supply chains. Measures of global economic uncertainty have
eased from their peak earlier in 2025 but remain high—well above pre-pandemic
norms and at levels typically linked with major crises.
Although some tariff measures were scaled back or delayed, U.S. bilateral tariff
rates have increased on almost all trade counterparts and the shift to
protectionist trade policy is clear.
-- 44 of 493 --

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 35
Early in 2025, the global economy proved more robust than anticipated.
Businesses accelerated imports ahead of new U.S. tariffs, while supportive
financial conditions driven by expectations of further policy interest rate cuts and
strong equity markets helped sustain economic activity.
Those favourable conditions are now fading. The impact of higher trade barriers
is becoming more visible with weaker reported earnings, trade being diverted
away from the U.S., slower domestic demand in major economies, and softening
labour markets. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) now sees higher tariffs
leading to inflationary pressure re-emerging in the U.S., limiting the scope for
further monetary stimulus.
Chart 4 – U.S. Average Tariff Rate, all U.S. imports
Sources: U.S Census Bureau; Department of Finance Canada calculations.
Looking ahead, international organisations—including the IMF and the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)—expect
global growth to slow in the second half of 2025 and into 2026 (Chart 5).
New trade tensions are reshaping the global economy, creating uncertainty and
driving developments that affect oil prices, exchange rates, and long-term
interest rates—also impacting Canada’s economic outlook.
• 	Oil prices—an important driver of Canada’s economy and fiscal position—
remain low and volatile. Soft global demand growth and continued OPEC+
production increases have weighed on markets. West Texas Intermediate
(WTI) has traded between US$57 and US$81 this year, and is currently
hovering around US$60 per barrel, substantially lower levels than expected
in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement (FES 2024).

• 	The U.S. dollar has fallen by about 7 per cent against other major currencies
since the start of the year, as softer growth prospects and market concerns
about its safe-haven status weigh on the currency. A weaker U.S. dollar lifts
the Canadian dollar—helping ease inflation but reducing support exporters
might otherwise receive amid new U.S. trade barriers.
• 	Long-term sovereign bond yields have declined in the U.S. and Canada
since July, amid expectations of greater monetary policy easing. However,
yields remain elevated—or have even risen further—in some advanced
economies over the past two years as markets price in concerns about the
long-term sustainability of fiscal policy and demand higher premiums on
government debt. Yields in Canada remain lower relative to peers (Chart 6),
reflecting strong investor confidence in Canada’s fiscal position.

2. Canadian Economic Context
The Canadian Economy in the Face of New Tariffs
From an age when free trade was a motor of global economic growth, we have
entered an age of economic nationalism and mercantilism. Canada’s largest
export market, the U.S., is fundamentally reshaping all its trading relationships.
The U.S. tariff rate is now the highest it has been since the Great Depression in
the 1930s, and these tariffs are being applied to all countries and nearly all
goods. The trade war and the uncertainty it created has had profound effects on
the Canadian economy.
After growing by more than 2 per cent in the second half of 2024, real GDP in
Canada rose at an annualised pace of 0.2 per cent. Growth reached 2.0 per cent
in the first quarter but contracted by 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, as trade
activity brought forward in the two previous quarters unwound and new tariffs
came into effect.
Despite headwinds, the Canadian economy has shown resilience and private
sector forecasters expect modest growth to resume in the second half of 2025.
The IMF predicts that Canada will have the second fastest annual growth in the
G7 (after the U.S.) in both 2026 and 2027.
The impact of higher U.S. tariffs and ongoing uncertainty on the Canadian
economy has been evident:
• 	Exports contracted sharply, even as U.S. growth remained strong, and
manufacturing sales declined as new tariffs were imposed.
• 	Business sentiment has weakened in this environment (Chart 7), with
declines across many sectors, including those exposed to trade.
• 	Investment pulled-back in the first half of the year as businesses delayed or
cancelled projects. Private sector forecasters expect investment weakness
throughout 2025 (Chart 8), dragging on the economy’s productive capacity.
• 	There were job losses in tariff-targeted sectors and those most exposed to
trade, and hiring has been subdued among other sectors.

However, the Canadian economy has shown resilience, with domestic-facing
sectors faring better. This highlights the importance of strengthening the
domestic economy through investment in infrastructure and housing, including
through Buy Canadian initiatives, while continuing to diversify trade and expand
export markets.
Household spending has remained solid, with indications this strength continued
over the summer months. Household balance sheets have benefitted from solid
real wage gains, elevated household savings, lower borrowing costs, and rising
asset values (Chart 9). At the same time, reduced travel to the U.S. and Buy
Canadian initiatives have redirected some spending towards domestic products
and services, providing additional support to local economies. Housing activity is
returning to growth after a period of sharp pullback, although conditions remain
uneven across regions.

The impact of new tariffs and the uncertainty they have caused is expected to
continue to build. The outlook for growth is weaker than projected in the FES
2024 (Chart 10). Private sector economists expect real GDP growth to resume
in the second half of 2025, with annualised growth of 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per
cent in the third and fourth quarter, respectively.
Tariffs and supply chain disruptions are expected to drag on business
investment and productivity. Combined with slower population growth, the
level of real GDP is projected to be 1.8 per cent below what was anticipated in
the FES 2024 before the trade conflict (Chart 11). Slower economic activity
weighs on Canada’s fiscal capacity. The Department of Finance’s sensitivity
analysis shows that this type of economic shock could result in a deterioration
of the budgetary balance by $7 billion per year, on average, over the forecast
horizon (see Annex 1 for details on the sensitivity of fiscal projections to
economic shocks).

Canadian Exports Amid New Tariffs
Canada’s exporters are facing growing challenges from higher tariffs, uncertainty
over future trade rules, and lower global demand. Exports to our largest trading
partner have seen large declines, after initial front-loading of shipments as
businesses tried to get ahead of the new tariffs. Newly added energy export
capacity, such as the Trans Mountain expansion and LNG Canada, has cushioned
some of the decline in exports.
Businesses in sectors directly targeted by tariffs, and the regions where these
sectors have the largest footprint, have been the hardest hit. While domestic sales
have partially offset weaker U.S. demand and firms have built up inventories, these
have not fully made up the shortfall, and output in affected sectors has declined.
• 	The value of Canadian exports to all destinations are down 7.2 per cent in
August relative to their 2024 average, including exports to the U.S.
declining by 10.4 per cent.
• 	Steep declines have been seen in steel and aluminum exports where
volumes are down 33 and 32 per cent respectively in August relative to
their 2024 average (Chart 12). The U.S. first introduced 25 per cent tariffs
on these products in March, then doubled them to 50 per cent in June.
• 	China has applied 76 per cent tariffs on Canadian canola seed, and 100
per cent tariffs on canola oil and oilcake—effectively shutting Canadian
canola out of the Chinese market. Canola exports are down 17 per cent
since 2024.

• 	Auto and auto parts exports are down 9 per cent since 2024, yet this masks
what would have been a pickup in growth if not for trade tensions. Planned
expansions in the sector have been delayed, put on hold, or cancelled
entirely due to trade uncertainty.
• 	Despite most Canadian goods entering the U.S. duty-free, exports outside
of directly tariffed sectors have also declined, reflecting spillovers from
weakening industrial demand in the U.S.
• 	There has been an encouraging pivot toward other destinations for exports
since 2024 (Chart 13). In particular, exports of metal and non-metallic
mineral products, energy, consumer goods, and electrical equipment to
third country trade partners are all up more than 7 per cent in August
relative to 2024, as firms seek to diversify trade and new export capacity
for energy has come online.

• 	The pace of export decline has slowed in the third quarter as further
declines in tariffed sectors were partially offset by recovering energy
shipments and the launch of LNG Canada. Yet, steep declines earlier in the
year have left exports well below last year’s levels. Forecasters expect
exports to continue lagging growth in the broader economy over the next
two years, as elevated tariffs weigh on U.S. demand and new markets take
time to develop.

• 	Expanding global partnerships with reliable, like-minded countries—
including the EU, Korea, Japan, and Mexico—will help open new markets
and reduce overreliance on any single trading partner, improving the long-
term resilience of Canadian exporters.
Labour Market Amid Trade Uncertainty
The U.S. tariffs have had impacts throughout the labour market. Businesses are
pausing hiring plans in response to new tariffs and trade tensions. This has
interrupted the labour market recovery that had taken hold in late 2024.
Employment growth has slowed since January but rebounded in September,
adding 60,000 jobs and offsetting earlier losses. Most of the rise in unemployment
comes from slower hiring, as businesses delay or cancel job postings.
Layoffs have increased slightly from historically low levels but have stabilised
recently, and new Employment Insurance claims remain relatively low, unlike
previous episodes of economic slowdown.
Some Canadians are feeling the effects more acutely:
• 	Job losses have been concentrated in trade-exposed sectors (Chart 14) like
manufacturing, which has shed about 30,000 jobs since January.
Employment in these sectors may remain subdued as businesses adjust to
weaker U.S. demand. While unemployment has risen in most provinces, the
largest increases have been in manufacturing-focused regions including
Windsor and Oshawa in Ontario, and parts of British Columbia (Chart 15).
• 	Young people are being disproportionately affected by weaker hiring. Youth
unemployment rose from 12.9 per cent in February to 14.7 per cent in
September—the highest level since 2010 outside of the pandemic period.
• 	With fewer hiring opportunities across many sectors, job searches are taking
longer, pushing up long-term unemployment.
• 	Building the economy of the future requires ensuring that workers and
industries are equipped to seize opportunities. We will create a strong,
confident workforce by introducing a new reskilling package for up to
50,000 workers, making Employment Insurance more flexible and with
extended benefits, and launching a new digital jobs and training platform
with private-sector partners to connect Canadians more quickly to careers.
-- 52 of 493 --

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 43
• 	The labour force has expanded more gradually as a result of slower
population growth and immigration rates returning to sustainable levels under
the 2025-2027 Immigration Levels Plan. These measures have helped ease
pressure on the labour market, containing overall unemployment. Slower
hiring has made it harder for youth and newcomers to find their first job,
highlighting integration challenges for newcomers and entry barriers for
young workers. Youth have faced particular strain, with their unemployment
rate rising by 5.7 percentage points since 2022. Managed immigration growth
is now helping to stabilise labour-market conditions and is expected to
support better outcomes for youth.
• 	The 2025-2027 Immigration Levels Plan is already delivering results: new
temporary foreign worker arrivals have fallen by about 50 per cent this year,
and new international student arrivals are roughly 60 per cent lower than in
2024. Asylum claims are also down by one-third so far in 2025.
Labour force participation among women and prime-aged workers has fallen
slightly but remains high by historical and international standards:
• 	Canadians remain engaged with the labour market and businesses continue
to have a large pool of labour supply to draw from.
The unemployment rate is projected to remain elevated over the forecast horizon,
peaking at around 7.2 per cent by the end of year before gradually easing.

Progress on Housing Supply Helping Ease Pressures
After softening earlier in the year, the housing market has stabilised, with home
resales and new housing starts picking up once again, although activity remains
uneven across regions. Housing affordability has improved for both renters and
home buyers, supported by government actions such as investments in purpose-
built rental construction, lower immigration targets, and new supports for first-
time home buyers.
• 	The elimination of the GST for first-time home buyers on homes up to
$1 million and recent changes to mortgage rules will help make
homeownership a reality for more Canadians.
• 	Home sales have risen in five of the past six months, and forward-looking
indicators—including sales-to-new-listings ratios and inventory levels—point
to broadly balanced market conditions at the national level.
• 	Easing home prices, lower interest rates, and robust income growth have
improved affordability for first-time home buyers. The Bank of Canada’s
housing affordability index has been improving for seven consecutive
quarters, supported by a 2.75 percentage-points reduction in the policy rate
since May 2024 and easing resale prices in several housing markets.
• 	Housing starts have trended upward this year, averaging 277,000 units
over the past six months—the highest level since 2021—driven by
government-supported strength in purpose-built rental construction.
• 	Strong rental construction, combined with early government measures to
responsibly manage immigration and population growth, has alleviated
housing pressures, with average asking rents down 3.2 per cent over the
past year (Charts 16 and 17).
• 	Government policies, such as the Apartment Construction Loan Program
and Mortgage Loan Insurance, have helped maintain elevated levels of
construction activity, particularly in the rental segment.
Government efforts are already helping to scale up the supply of homes and
bring down costs.
-- 54 of 493 --

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 45
But restoring affordability over the long term will require sustaining this
momentum and closing the supply gap. This is why Canada’s new government is
taking measures to double the pace of construction to build millions of new
homes, including through a new agency, Build Canada Homes.
• 	Canada’s new government launched Build Canada Homes which will help
double the pace of homebuilding over the next decade to increase housing
supply, alongside other measures. It will also transform public-private
collaboration and deploy modern methods of construction, as it catalyses
the creation of an entirely new Canadian housing industry.
• 	Build Canada Homes will deploy capital, create demand, and harness
innovative housing technologies to build faster and more sustainably, 365
days a year. Build Canada Homes will place an intense focus on using cost-
efficient and modern methods of construction such as factory-built,
modular, and mass timber. Through bulk procurement and long-term
financing, Build Canada Homes will mainstream these advanced methods of
construction—with the potential to cut building timelines by up to 50 per
cent, reduce costs by as much as 20 per cent, and lower emissions by
approximately 20 per cent during construction.
• 	The federal government is working with other levels of government to take
action through a comprehensive suite of policy measures. These include
low-cost financing for builders, incentives for purpose-built rental
construction, cutting red tape, infrastructure investments, and initiatives to
expand the skilled construction workforce.
• 	Investments in new supply are being coupled by actions to responsibly
manage immigration to alleviate pressures on housing demand. The 2026-
2028 Immigration Levels Plan will return immigration to sustainable levels
by stabilising new permanent resident admissions at less than one per cent
of the Canadian population beyond 2027 and reducing the total number of
temporary residents to less than 5 per cent of the population by the end of
2027, down from a peak of 7.6 per cent in 2024.

Inflation Remains Within the Target Range
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation remains near 2 per cent, at 2.4 per cent in
September, and has stayed within the Bank of Canada’s 1 to 3 per cent target
range for the past 21 months. Canada has seen faster disinflation than many of
its peers (Chart 18). The removal of the federal consumer carbon price in April
helped to lower costs.
The strength of past costs pressures continues to keep underlying inflation
elevated. Excluding indirect taxes, inflation was 2.9 per cent in September, and
measures of core inflation have held slightly around 3 per cent in recent months.
This reflects a few lingering forces:
• 	Goods inflation (excluding energy) remains firm due to earlier global cost
pressures that passed through to import prices. This was driven by global
factors such as a weaker Canadian dollar in late 2024, higher industrial prices,
and elevated global shipping costs—though these factors have eased recently.
• 	Food prices have risen globally, including in Canada, reflecting past cost
increases such as the depreciation of many global currencies against the U.S.
dollar in late 2024. These past cost increases are still feeding through to food
prices. Elevated global commodity prices and supply disruptions have also
added further pressure. The increase in food prices in Canada is of a similar
magnitude as its peers (Chart 19).

• 	Energy inflation remains moderate following the removal of the consumer
carbon price, though higher global refinery margins, driven by tight supply
and robust demand, have offset some of the decline.
• 	Services inflation is still elevated, though shelter inflation is easing.
Moderation in mortgage interest costs is expected to continue and the
decline in rent inflation is expected to resume as population growth cools
and more rental supply comes online, driving market rents down.

Wage growth is putting more money in the pockets of Canadians, with
paycheques rising even after accounting for inflation. Wage growth has now
outpaced inflation for nearly three years (Chart 20).
Looking ahead, inflation is expected to remain close to 2 per cent as upward and
downward price pressures balance each other:
• 	Higher U.S. tariffs on their imports are increasing production costs for
Canadian firms, which could add to domestic inflation. Cost pressures
resulting from supply chain realignment as firms diversify their suppliers
could also spill over into Canadian consumer prices, given tightly integrated
North American supply chains.

• 	The removal of most Canadian countermeasures means less upward
pressure on many U.S. sourced goods prices going forward.
• 	Slower domestic demand and softer labour market conditions putting
downward pressures on unit labour costs will weigh down inflation
more broadly.
The Bank of Canada has lowered interest rates significantly, providing support
to domestic demand and the Canadian economy. Since May 2024, the policy
rate has been cut by 2.75 percentage points to 2.25 per cent—below the
midpoint of the Bank’s estimated neutral range. The Bank of Canada has eased
monetary policy earlier and more decisively than many peers in this easing cycle,
thanks in part to faster disinflation (Chart 21).
On October 29, the Bank cut its policy rate by 25 basis points, citing ongoing
weakness in the economy and fewer upside risks to inflation. The Bank further
noted that the policy rate was at the right level to help the economy through
the current period of adjustment.

3. Canadian Economic Outlook
Global Uncertainty Is Impacting Canada’s Outlook
The Department of Finance regularly surveys private sector economists on their
views on the outlook for the Canadian economy (see Annex 1 for more detailed
discussion of forecast results).
Since 1994, Canada has used the average of private sector forecasts as the
foundation for its economic and fiscal planning. This approach supports
objectivity and transparency, and introduces a degree of independence into the
government’s forecast process—a practice endorsed by international institutions
such as the IMF.
In the August 2025 survey, forecasters incorporated new tariff measures and
trade policy developments that were known at the time of the survey. In
particular, they incorporated the uncertainty tariffs create and the burden they
have placed on the Canadian economy. A gradual de-escalation of U.S. tariffs
was assumed over the next two years, but a return to broadly open, low-tariff
global trade was not anticipated.
Despite this uncertainty, forecasters expect modest growth in the second half of
the year (Chart 23), after the economy stalled in the first half of the year. In this
outlook, exports and business investment remain weak due to U.S. tariffs and
uncertain demand prospects. Household spending remains robust but moderates
along with weaker labour market conditions and slowing population growth.
Real GDP growth is projected to recover through 2026, supported by stabilising
exports and a recovery in domestic demand amid lower interest rates. As the
Canadian economy adjusts to the new trading environment, growth is expected
to pick up to reach around 2 per cent by 2027 and beyond.
Despite the trade war, real and nominal GDP in Canada are still expected to
expand. The IMF expects that Canada will see the second strongest real GDP
growth in the G7 in 2026, following only the U.S. (Chart 22).
Overall, private sector forecasters expect real GDP growth of 1.1 per cent in 2025
and 1.2 per cent in 2026—revised down from the FES 2024 outlook of 1.9 per cent
and 2.1 per cent, respectively. The level of real GDP is about 1.8 per cent lower
than forecast in FES 2024 by the end of 2027. GDP inflation is expected to
average 2.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 (compared to 2.0 per cent in
-- 59 of 493 --

50
both years in FES 2024) but is broadly similar to the FES 2024 outlook afterwards.
Over the forecast horizon (2025-2029), the level of nominal GDP is lower than the
FES 2024 projection by $40 billion on average per year.
In the August survey, private sector economists expect:
• 	Disinflation from the consumer carbon price removal and excess supply to
largely offset cost pressures from tariffs and supply chain disruptions. As a
result, CPI inflation is projected to average 2.1 per cent in 2025 and 2.0 per
cent thereafter, consistent with the FES 2024 forecast.
• 	Trade tensions continue to weigh on labour demand, resulting in the
unemployment rate peaking at 7.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2025,
averaging 7.0 per cent for the year (compared to 6.7 per cent in the FES
2024). It is projected to decline to 6.0 per cent by 2029.
• 	The Bank of Canada to keep its policy rate at 2.25 per cent through 2026.
• 	Short-term interest rates to be about 30 basis points lower on average than
forecast in FES 2024, settling around 2.5 per cent by the end of the
forecast period in 2030.
• 	The 10-year bond rate to increase from an average of 3.3 per cent in 2025
to 3.6 per cent in 2029 (about 15 basis points higher than anticipated in
FES 2024).
• 	Forecasters in the survey saw greater risks to the downside given the
possibility of escalating trade tensions, higher impacts from U.S. tariffs
and trade policy uncertainty, and a potential financial market repricing
(Chart 24).

Economic Scenario Analysis
The August 2025 survey provides a reasonable foundation for economic and
fiscal planning. However, the full impact of tariffs and trade uncertainty are still
unfolding, and risks remain on multiple fronts. A core mission of the new
government is to help households and businesses emerge stronger from global
economic shifts by investing in the economy to catalyse growth and build
resilience in the long run.
To support responsible planning amid this high uncertainty, the Department of
Finance has developed downside and upside scenarios around the August 2025
survey forecast.
Downside Scenario
In this scenario, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated, leaving consumers
and businesses cautious in spending and investment.
• 	Global headwinds weigh on oil prices and financial assets, while a weaker
U.S. economy reduces demand for Canadian exports. Adjusting to new U.S.
tariffs proves more challenging than anticipated, dampening productivity
growth.

• 	Combined, these factors result in a decline in real GDP in the third quarter
of 2025, followed by stalled activity in the fourth quarter and a protracted
period of slower growth and higher unemployment (Chart 25).
• 	Nominal GDP is, on average, lower by $51 billion per year over the forecast
horizon relative to the August 2025 survey forecast (Chart 26).
Upside Scenario
In the upside scenario, trade policy uncertainty eases more rapidly as the U.S.
concludes trade agreements with major partners and global tensions ease.
Domestic measures to streamline internal trade, bolster competition, and
diversify and deepen global partnerships contribute to a more predictable
business environment.
• 	Stronger-than-expected U.S. growth and higher global oil prices increase
demand for Canadian exports, and there is a faster recovery in consumer
spending and business investment.
• 	The scenario incorporates modest productivity gains, reflecting the positive
impacts of structural reforms that remove barriers to investment and
productivity.
• 	Nominal GDP is, on average, about $25 billion higher per year over the
forecast horizon relative to the August 2025 survey forecast.

4. Building a Strong and
Competitive Economy
Canada’s Path Forward is to Improve Productivity
A strong economy is tied to strong productivity. Productivity growth, the basis
of rising living standards and economic competitiveness, means finding ways for
businesses and workers to produce more with the same effort.
• 	When productivity grows everyone benefits: the wages and incomes of
hard-working Canadians rise, businesses have the conditions to grow and to
create more jobs, and Canada stays competitive in global markets.
• 	If Canada’s productivity growth had matched the U.S. from 2017 to
2023, the median income of a family with one child would be nearly
$11,000 higher.
• 	A strong economy driven by productivity growth also provides steady
revenues needed to fund the public services Canadians count on.
Over the past decade, Canada’s productivity performance has been persistently
weak. In this time, productivity grew by only 0.3 per cent annually—less than
one-third the pace of the previous two decades (Chart 27). This had led to
substantial productivity gaps with other G7 economies (Chart 28).

Perennially weak productivity growth is closely tied to longstanding weakness in
investment. For decades, Canadian firms have invested less per worker than
their American counterparts. This investment gap has worsened since 2015
after the collapse in commodity prices contributed to a sharp fall in energy
investment.
• 	Overall business investment within Canada has been flat over the past
decade, while business investment in the U.S. has risen sharply (Chart 29).
Much of this weakness has been driven by a retrenchment in capital
spending by Canada’s energy sector following the sharp decline in global oil
prices in 2015, and the contrasting increase in U.S. technology investment
in recent years.
• 	Canada’s economy has also faced weak investment in machinery and
equipment, research and development, and intangible assets like intellectual
property, data, and software that is pervasive across sectors.
Businesses often perceive the risks and costs of investments in high-risk and
innovative assets as outweighing the rewards, a mindset reinforced by structural
impediments such as the regulatory environment, limited competition, and scale
constraints. In addition, Canada’s economy remains oriented toward lower-growth
activities, with limited export exposure to dynamic, high-growth markets abroad,
and relatively weak investment in technology. Overcoming these barriers will
require a structural shift toward greater risk-taking and a stronger focus on
innovation-driven growth.
The most immediate way to jumpstart productivity growth is to address structural
impediments and increase investment—in machinery, equipment, innovation, and
infrastructure that allow workers to build faster and at a more competitive cost.
This includes tackling longstanding weaknesses such as internal trade barriers,
enhancing regulations and project approval processes, and increasing competition
(Chart 30)—all proven measures to strengthen competitiveness, attract private
investment, and supercharge growth.

Canada must also look to new high-growth markets and invest in technology
that can unlock its economic potential. Doing so will position the economy for
success in the future defined by the twin transformations of digitalisation and
decarbonisation that are driven by technology advancement.
The status quo is no longer an option—the current challenges require a
comprehensive response. We must drive Canada’s productivity growth to
reinvigorate Canada’s industrial capacity, which will allow us to successfully
pivot to other markets, build more homes, and leverage our natural resources.
Canada’s New Industrial Strategy
Canada is already among the most prosperous countries in the world. We enjoy
the comparative advantages of being an energy superpower, having a highly
skilled workforce, the ability to attract top global talent, and an abundance of
critical minerals and other resources that the world needs. But to thrive in the
rapidly evolving global economy, Canada must build its strength at home. To
that end, through Budget 2025, the government is taking a proactive approach
with the introduction of a new comprehensive industrial strategy to drive
productivity and build a stronger economy that protects Canadian workers,
builds major infrastructure, buys Canadian goods, and diversifies our exports.

High-Impact Actions for Lasting Growth
High impact actions to drive
productivity growth can deliver
benefits that compound over time—
supporting higher wages, stronger
private sector investment, and greater
resilience to future shocks.
Canada’s new government is taking
these high-return actions:
• Infrastructure projects: connecting
markets and regions, enabling
private investment
• Public investment in R&D: fostering
innovation and accelerates
technology adoption
• Regulatory reforms: cutting red
tape that slows private investment,
limits trade and labour mobility, and
restricts competition
Chart 31: Typical Range of Economic
Returns per Dollar of Public Investment
Note: Economic return refers to GDP.
Source: Department of Finance Canada calculations
• Productivity super-deduction:
providing enhanced tax incentives
that help companies recover
investment costs faster
The combined effect of high-return actions can create a virtuous cycle of
economic growth. For instance, improved infrastructure can facilitate the
dissemination of new technologies developed through public investment in
R&D, while regulatory reforms can ensure that these technologies are adopted
efficiently across industries. Over time, these high-return actions can lead to a
more dynamic and resilient economy.
These high-return actions will help to catalyse $500 billion in private
investment over the next five years. The economic impact of achieving such
target would be substantial, compounding over time through higher
productivity. To illustrate, with $500 billion in additional private investment, real
GDP could be about 3.5 per cent higher than otherwise by 2030, reflecting the
enduring benefits of a more capital-rich economy. Over the same period,
Canadians’ purchasing power would strengthen, with real GDP per capita
$1,400 higher per year, on average. This lift in output could improve the
budgetary balance by an average of $7 billion per year over the forecast horizon.
All these benefits underscore the importance of capital-driven economic growth
for Canada’s economy.

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 57
Recent and newly proposed measures in Budget 2025 will work together to
catalyse a virtuous cycle of investment and strengthen productivity over the
years to come. In addition to crowding-in private sector investment at a time of
economic uncertainty, they are collectively designed to address critical policy
challenges through renewed industrialisation of Canada.
• 	The new Major Projects Office will fast-track nation-building projects and
coordinate federal financing to help build projects faster. These projects will
connect our country, attract domestic and global capital, and create high-
paying careers.
• 	Build Canada Homes will catalyse the creation of an entirely new Canadian
housing industry that uses modern methods of construction to boost
productivity, sustainably and at scale.
• 	Canada’s new Defence Industrial Strategy will strengthen our industrial
capabilities, give ourselves the tools we need to meet our defence
requirements, and seize the opportunities that arise. With increased
procurement there are more opportunities for Canadian workers, businesses,
and manufacturing across supply chains, supporting Canadian steel, aluminum,
critical minerals, and cyber industries. These investments will also help Canada
realise its NATO commitments, enhancing our collective security.
• 	With the new government’s Buy Canadian Policy, we will be our own best
customers. When we build, we will do so with Canadian goods and suppliers.
This requires an economy that is more unified than it has ever been by
removing internal trade barriers to increase flows of goods and services
across the country—creating One Canadian Economy.
• 	The new Climate Competitiveness Strategy—combining strengthened
industrial carbon pricing, a streamlined regulatory environment and
aggressive tax incentives—will accelerate investment to drive down
emissions in key sectors, boost market access for Canadian exports, and
grow jobs and the economy.
• 	Our Trade Diversification Strategy will build a new web of trade
relationships around the globe and open new markets for Canadian
businesses. This will help Canada transition from an economy reliant on one
trade partner to one resilient to global shocks.

Enabling $1 Trillion In Total Investment
To drive productivity, boost the capacity of Canada’s economy and to secure a
prosperous future for Canadians, Canada needs a sea change to reverse
Canada’s history of weak private sector investment. The government is acting
decisively by improving regulatory efficiency, increasing competition, boosting
tax incentives for new investments, and promoting generational investments in
housing and infrastructure.
We will attract private capital by accelerating major projects. The first five
projects referred to the new Major Projects Office collectively represent
$60 billion in total capital investment. Further nation building projects will be
announced this month. Taken together, these nation-building projects are
expected to trigger at least $150 billion in total capital investment.
Budget 2025 will attract further investment by unlocking AI data centres,
building the next generation of infrastructure, supercharging housing
construction, and developing our defence industry. The Budget will encourage
companies to invest and innovate in Canada through investment tax credits, the
Productivity Super-Deduction, and improvements to the Scientific Research and
Experimental Development tax incentives.
The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put Canada on track to meet our
investment objectives. Of the government’s planned capital spending over five
years, about $280 billion (cash basis) is in support of third parties. These
incentives and this planned spending enable more than $1 trillion in total
investments. As they are realised, the return on this investment will be more
jobs, faster growth and more resources to support social programs so that all
Canadians get ahead.

-- 68 of 493 --

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 59
These generational investments will create demand for domestic production
while supporting growth of our strategic sectors and empowering Canada to
capitalise on its natural advantages. Enabling investments for our resources
sectors will allow Canada to maintain its core economic strengths while
transitioning our economy to a cleaner future.
Investment in the areas of skills and technology will also help build new
capabilities and bolster Canada’s productive capacity. Canada has a significant
potential, comparable if not better than other advanced economies, in emerging
technologies such as AI or Quantum computing (Chart 32). Investments that
help set the foundation during the early adoption stage could enhance Canada’s
future growth prospects in these critical technologies. The government will
continue to support the growth of these technologies in Canada and develop a
new AI strategy by the end of 2025.
These measures are further reinforced
by a series of actions to build a
competitive marketplace where
businesses can live up to their full
potential. Canada’s new industrial
strategy will seek to streamline
regulations, fast-track project
approvals, introduce pro-competitive
reforms, and reduce taxes on
investment to enable both the public
and private sector to move quicky to
build Canada strong.
The goal is clear—boost Canada’s
productive capacity to build a
stronger economy; protect our
industries, workers and sovereignty; and empower Canadians through greater
affordability and the resources to excel in a rapidly evolving global economic
future. To achieve this goal, Canada needs more business investment, fewer
barriers to growth, and more competition. With further steps in Budget 2025,
the government’s new industrial strategy is advancing these objectives.

5. Economic Strength Through
Fiscal Discipline
Realising the full potential of the government’s new industrial strategy will
require doing things differently. Over the past decade, government spending
has grown rapidly, with direct program expenses increasing by 8 per cent
annually—a pace that is no longer sustainable. To make the generational
investments needed to strengthen Canada’s industries, support its workers, and
defend its values and interests, the federal government will need a new
approach, one that spends less to invest more.
We will make responsible choices to spend less on government operations and
reduce wasteful spending, so Canadians can invest more in the workers,
businesses, and nation-building infrastructure that will build Canada strong.
This new approach is guided by two fiscal anchors:
Balance operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting
the composition of spending from day-to-day operations to
investments that support capital formation and productivity.
Maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, reflecting disciplined
fiscal management that safeguards economic stability for future
generations.
In addition to these anchors, the government’s new fiscal approach will be
driven by one overarching target to catalyse $500 billion in new private
sector investments over the next five years, by focusing federal spending
toward capital formation and projects that attract private investment, creating a
virtuous cycle of investment and economic growth.
New Approach to Budgeting
To help the government shift its focus and drive capital formation across the
economy, it is implementing a new Capital Budgeting Framework. Announced on
October 6, the Framework provides a consistent way to classify spending,
including tax expenditures, that contributes to capital formation (called ‘capital
investment’) from day-to-day operating spending. Capital investments are the
building blocks to economic growth. The Framework encompasses spending not
only on the government’s own assets, but also support for capital formation by
other levels of government and the private sector. For example, it includes
-- 71 of 493 --

62
transfers to provinces and territories under infrastructure agreements and
capital-focused tax incentives such as the clean economy investment tax credits.
Importantly, the Framework is meant to enhance—not replace—existing financial
reporting. Further details on the Capital Budgeting Framework can be found in
Annex 2.
This framework now guides budget decisions toward measures that empower
Canada to capitalise on its advantages and grow our economy, all while
keeping overall spending sustainable. As highlighted by the IMF in its October
2025 Fiscal Monitor, redirecting government spending toward areas that
increase an economy’s productive capacity—such as infrastructure—while
improving efficiency in less productive areas (e.g., administrative overhead) can
unlock substantial long-term economic gains.
In relation to the government’s recent actions, the Managing Director of the
IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, noted “In the case of Canada, the Canadian
authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing
relations with their main trading partner.”
Consistent with this framework, a significant portion of net new spending in
Budget 2025 is classified as capital investment, totaling more than $32.5 billion
over five years. This includes key measures to further Canada’s new industrial
strategy, by:
• 	improving and expanding community and regional infrastructure through a
new Build Communities Strong Fund;
• 	driving growth and innovation through a new Productivity Super-
Deduction;
• 	supercharging homebuilding and productivity in construction through Build
Canada Homes; and,
• 	rebuilding domestic production capacity through a Defence Industrial Strategy.
Cumulative capital investment over the 2024-25 to 2029-30 period, inclusive of
planned investments in this budget, is expected to total $311.5 billion on an
accrual basis, or $502.2 billion on a cash basis. With measures in the budget,
annual capital investment will also nearly double from $32.2 billion in 2024-25 to
$59.6 billion in 2029-30 (Chart 33). As a share of the deficit, capital investment will
grow from 58 per cent in 2025-26 to 100 per cent from 2028-29 onwards (Chart
34).

To remain fiscally sustainable, the shift in spending toward capital investment
requires a reduction in day-to-day operating spending. Budget 2025 delivers on
this through an ambitious savings plan—the Comprehensive Expenditure
Review—which will reduce duplication and inefficiencies and realign activities
towards the core federal mandate. The Comprehensive Expenditure Review will
rein in government spending—saving Canada $13 billion annually by 2028-29
(detailed in Annex 3), for a total with other savings and revenues of $60 billion
over five years. With these efforts, growth in direct program expenses is expected
to average under 1 per cent over the Budget 2025 planning horizon, compared to
8 per cent over the last decade.

Over the next four years, capital investments in the economy as well as major
transfers to people, provinces, and territories will grow, but spending on other
expenses will fall. With this prudent fiscal management, by 2028-29, the
government will meet its anchor of balancing its day-to-day operating
spending with revenues, creating the fiscal space needed in this budget to
make generational investments in Canada’s future.

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 65
Through the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, and the introduction of new
and better tools such as AI, the tech-enabled public service of the future will
continue to deliver the services that Canadians depend on, while bringing public
service growth in line with forecasted Canadian population growth.
Beginning with this budget, as announced on October 6, the government is also
transitioning to a fall budgeting cycle. This new timing will facilitate expenditure
oversight by Parliamentarians and help builders, investors, and every level of
government to make smarter, faster decisions. Providing certainty and
predictability is what unlocks investment—so that projects can begin as soon as
construction season starts. Fall budgets will be complemented by economic and
fiscal updates in the spring.
Fiscal Outlook
The impact of recent U.S. tariffs and uncertainty over future trade rules have
weighed on the Canadian economy. The downward revisions to the economic
outlook relative to FES 2024 could be expected to result in an average
estimated deterioration in the budgetary balance of $7 billion per year over the
forecast horizon.
The deficit in 2025-26 also reflects the proactive steps the government has
taken to stand up for Canadians and invest in our future growth, including
through Budget 2025. Notably, the government has acted to:
• 	Respond to global economic shifts and protect Canada’s sovereignty,
including by investing:
◦ 	$3.0 billion in 2025-26 to support workers and industries in sectors
most impacted by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, helping them
reskill, retool, and pivot to their future.
◦ 	$7.2 billion in 2025-26 to rebuild, rearm, and reinvest in the Canadian
Armed Forces, enabling Canada to achieve NATO’s 2 per cent defence
target this fiscal year, half a decade ahead of schedule.
• 	Deploy $10.4 billion in 2025-26 to bolster the economy while reducing
costs for Canadians, including by cutting taxes and increasing investments
to build more homes.
These measures are intended to respond to immediate challenges while building
Canada’s long-term economic strength and security.
-- 75 of 493 --

66
Looking beyond 2025-26, with the actions taken in Budget 2025 to spend less
to invest more, the government is meeting its fiscal anchor as the projected
deficit as a share of the economy declines across the horizon, from 2.5 per cent
in 2025-26 to 1.5 per cent by 2029-30. The federal debt-to-GDP ratio also
remains relatively stable across the horizon.
Prudent fiscal management keeps Canada’s finances on a sustainable path, and
will help preserve the country’s fiscal advantage when compared to G7 peers.

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 67
The government’s new budgeting approach ensures that by 2028-29 deficits
reflect investments that support capital formation—capital investments will go
from slightly more than half of the deficit this year to all of it in 2028-29 and future
years. This necessary shift is key to the government realising its target of catalysing
$500 billion in additional private sector investment over the next five years.
By encouraging growth, the benefits of these investments compound over time, as
output and income increase. This in turn will generate additional fiscal revenues—
which for prudence are not included in Budget 2025 projections, enhancing
Canada’s capacity to meet future challenges. Measures included in Budget 2025
will have a net cost of $89.7 billion over five years. Of this, $32.5 billion will be
capital investment under the new Capital Budgeting Framework, including
generational investments to drive capital formation such as improving
infrastructure through a new Build Communities Strong Fund , supercharging
growth and homebuilding through a Productivity Super-Deduction and Build
Canada Homes, and increasing defence spending to protect Canada’s sovereignty
in a way that also grows the economy through a Defence Industrial Strategy.
Economic Scenario Analysis
Canada continues to rest on strong economic fundamentals that provide the
capacity to rebound from short-term shocks. However, higher U.S. tariffs and
rising geopolitical tensions have created significant uncertainty, heightening
risks to the economic and fiscal outlook.
To facilitate prudent economic and fiscal planning around these risks and to
further stress-test its baseline forecast, the Department of Finance has
developed downside and upside scenarios of Canada’s economic outlook.
In the upside scenario the budgetary balance would improve by an average of
approximately $5.0 billion per year over the planning horizon. The federal debt-
to GDP ratio would stabilise in the near-term and fall more rapidly from 2026-
27 onward, reaching 42.2 per cent by 2029-30 (see Chart 37).
In the downside scenario, the budgetary balance would deteriorate by an average
of approximately $9.2 billion per year over the planning horizon. The federal
debt-to-GDP ratio would be expected to rise to 45.3 per cent by 2028-29
before falling to 45.2 per cent by 2029-30 (see Chart 38).
Full details of the government’s fiscal outlook and the fiscal impact of the
scenarios can be found in Annex 1.

Preserving Fiscal Firepower for Future Generations
In uncertain times, strategic investments today are the surest path to tomorrow’s
prosperity and security. That is why the government is shifting the fiscal debate
from “how much” we borrow to “why” we borrow—seizing generational
opportunities and ensuring that public dollars back high-impact actions with lasting
economic returns. Investing more while spending less on government operations
will help secure sustained economic and fiscal capacity well into the future.
The government’s economic plan is fiscally sustainable:
• 	Modelling scenarios developed by the Department of Finance show the
federal debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining trajectory over the longer term
(Chart 39).
• 	Long-term projections help illustrate that fiscal sustainability depends not
only on sound fiscal policies, but also on strong economic policies and
growth-enhancing investments, such as those presented in Budget 2025.
• 	These policies work together to catalyse a virtuous cycle of investment,
contributing to sustained increases in economic activity and, in turn,
helping lower the government’s debt burden.
• 	As an illustration, with $500 billion in additional private investment over
five years, real GDP could be about 3.5 per cent higher than otherwise
by 2030, which would produce an even more pronounced downward
trajectory for the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the longer-term.

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OVERVIEW 69
Preserving fiscal firepower is crucial to manage future pressures, including,
among others, from recessions, additional defence spending, population aging,
climate change, and the transition to net-zero emissions.
Chart 39 – Long-Term Projections of the Federal Debt
Notes: While based on reasonable assumptions, long-term projections should not be viewed as forecasts. Notably,
the baseline projection does not reflect all potential economic and fiscal impacts of the global economic evolutions
that Canada will have to navigate over the coming decades, nor does it fully reflect positive impacts that can be
expected to result from recent and future economic policies. Details and sensitivity analysis around these long-term
fiscal projections are presented in Annex 1. To illustrate the lasting impacts of a more capital-rich economy, the
stronger economic growth scenario assumes that real GDP is higher by about 3.5 per cent by 2030.

Maintaining Canada’s Fiscal Advantage
Across the globe, geopolitical instability, structural economic shifts, and
intensifying global competition are redefining the role of government. At the
same time, there is growing recognition that underinvestment carries a steep
cost—slower growth, eroded competitiveness, and weakened security.
Like Canada, many countries around the world are responding with bold,
forward-looking strategies that place investment in productivity, innovation, and
defence at the core of their fiscal and economic agendas.
Canada is well positioned to seize generational opportunities and turn this
moment of global uncertainty into one of national opportunity.
• 	Canada’s net debt-to-GDP ratio stands at just 13.3 per cent, compared to
the G7 average (excluding Canada) of 101.4 per cent (Chart 40).
• 	Canada’s net debt burden today is lower than that of any other G7 country,
and is even below the levels of those countries prior to the pandemic.
• 	Canada also has one of the smallest deficits in the G7 as a share of the
economy (Chart 41).

Canada’s fiscal position also stands out among a broader set of 30 other
advanced economies, posting a below-average deficit-to-GDP ratio and one of
the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratios among the group (Charts 42 and 43).
This marks a sharp contrast with Canada’s fiscal situation in the 1980s and early
1990s, when sustained deficits led to a rapid rise in the net debt burden and an
erosion of Canada’s fiscal advantage relative to its peers.
Canada is also one of only two G7 economies, along with Germany, to have an
AAA rating from major global credit rating agencies. Canada’s AAA credit ratings
help maintain investors’ confidence and contributes to maintaining low
borrowing costs.
The government’s new approach for a strong Canada, focused on driving high-
impact investments while reinforcing fiscal discipline by reducing day-to-day
operating spending, will help ensure Canada maintains its fiscal advantage going
forward.

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 75
Canada has always been a proud nation of builders. In our earliest years, we were
unified by a national railway. In the final years of the 1950s, the St. Lawrence
Seaway was fully completed with 15 locks linking the Great Lakes to the Atlantic
Ocean stretching over 3,700 kilometres. In the same decade, tens of thousands of
blasters, steelworkers, roadworkers, and carpenters started construction on the
Trans-Canada Highway.
These infrastructure projects connected our nation and built our economy. It is
time we start building again at speed and scale.
The new government’s core mission is to empower Canadians by building
Canada’s economic strength.
This call for action is more pertinent than ever with the trade war causing
uncertainty and presenting economic challenges. The latest Bank of Canada
Business Outlook Survey revealed that over 60 per cent of firms cited uncertainty
surrounding financial, economic, and political conditions as their most pressing
concern. This has been reflected in slower hiring and businesses delaying or
cancelling projects, with business investment falling by 8 per cent annualised in
the second quarter. Forecasters expect business investment weakness to persist
throughout 2025. However, this period of global change can be our opportunity
to invest in our economy and position Canada for stronger, more sustainable
growth in the future.
In a rapidly shifting global landscape, we cannot control what other nations do.
We can control what we choose to do—and we are choosing to build.
Budget 2025 capitalises on a generational opportunity—not seen since the
economic transformation engendered by C.D. Howe in the wake of the Second
World War—to transform our economy, our energy, our trade relations, and our
collective defence.
To help drive this transformation, the government is focused on catalysing private
sector investment in Canada—investment in machinery, equipment, and
innovation that enhances long-term growth potential and will help jumpstart and
sustain productivity growth.
Canada’s new government is focused on creating the conditions that allow
businesses to succeed—investing in strategic infrastructure, modernising
regulatory and competition frameworks, and accelerating the development and
adoption of critical technologies such as AI and clean technology.
-- 85 of 493 --

76 CHAPTER ONE
And we are already making progress. In a short time, the government has
launched the Major Projects Office to fast-track nation-building projects, and
Build Canada Homes, which will help double the pace of construction over the
next decade. As Canada’s new government embarks on these missions, we are
also ensuring Canadian workers and businesses have the tools they need to drive
this transformation and thrive from it.
In this time of uncertainty, there is also a heightened urgency to make our
economy more resilient and competitive. Through this budget, the government
will tackle structural issues that are holding back Canada’s economy—internal
trade barriers, burdensome regulation, and weak competition intensity.
Eliminating our barriers to growth will usher in a new era of economic security
and prosperity for Canadians.
1.1 	Accelerating Major
Nation-Building Projects
For too long, the construction of major infrastructure in Canada has been stalled
by arduous, inefficient approval processes. Uncertainty, red tape, and duplicated
and complicated review processes have all curbed investment.
Statistics Canada estimates that federal regulatory burden rose 37 per cent
between 2006 and 2021. Had it remained at 2006 levels, business investment in
2021 would have been 9 per cent higher.
Currently, to receive approval, major projects must undergo numerous reviews and
assessments that often happen one after the other, instead of all running in parallel.
A core mission of Canada’s new government is to accelerate the delivery of major
projects. With the Building Canada Act, we are fast-tracking nation-building
infrastructure projects by streamlining federal review and approval processes. This
will increase regulatory certainty, helping attract capital and strengthening our
industries. This is done all while maintaining strong environmental protections,
upholding Indigenous rights, and creating opportunities for Indigenous Peoples to
derive economic benefits from major project development. The government also
undertook a review aimed at eliminating red tape. Ministers have identified
approximately 500 recent improvements and forward-looking actions to reduce
regulatory red tape. These include getting agricultural products to market faster and
aligning transportation regulations with international standards to reduce costs and
make it easier for Canadian companies do business internationally.

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 77
Launching the Major Projects Office
Delivering on a key commitment under the Building Canada Act, on August 29, 2025,
the government launched the Major Projects Office (MPO) to serve as a single point
of contact to get nation-building projects built faster. The Major Projects Office will
help to identify projects that are in Canada’s national interest and work to fast-track
their development.
To be in Canada’s national interest, several criteria will be considered:
• 	Whether a project will strengthen Canada's autonomy, resilience, and security.
• 	Whether a project will provide economic or other benefits to Canada.
• 	The likelihood of successful project execution.
• 	Whether a project will advance the interests of Indigenous Peoples.
• 	Whether a project will contribute to clean growth and addressing
climate change.
The First Major Nation-Building Projects
In September 2025, the Prime Minister announced the first series of projects being
referred to the Major Projects Office for consideration:
• 	LNG Canada Phase 2, Kitimat, British Columbia: This project will double
LNG Canada’s capacity of liquefied natural gas, making it the second-largest
facility of its kind in the world. It is expected to attract significant private-
sector capital to Canada, contribute to our GDP growth, and support jobs
and economic growth in local communities. It will diversify our trading
partners and meet increasing global demand for secure, low-carbon energy
with Canadian LNG, contributing to worldwide energy security by increasing
the supply of available natural gas for Asian and European partners.
Leveraging Canada’s sustainable advantage, emissions are projected to be 35
per cent lower than the world’s best-performing LNG facilities and 60 per
cent lower than the global average.
• 	Darlington New Nuclear Project, Bowmanville, Ontario: This project will
make Canada the first G7 country to have an operational small modular
reactor (SMR), accelerating the commercialisation of a key technology that
could support Canadian and global clean energy needs while driving $500
million annually into Ontario’s nuclear supply chain. As announced in
October 2025, the government will invest $2 billion through Canada Growth
Fund into construction of this project. This follows an early works loan from
the Canada Infrastructure Bank. Once complete, Darlington’s first of four
planned SMR units will provide reliable, affordable, clean power to 300,000
-- 87 of 493 --

78 CHAPTER ONE
homes, while sustaining 3,700 jobs annually, including 18,000 during
construction, over the next 65 years. The project has the potential to
position Canada as a global leader in the deployment of SMR technology for
use across the country and worldwide.
• 	Contrecœur Terminal Container Project, Contrecœur, Québec: This project will
expand the Port of Montréal’s capacity by approximately 60 per cent, to give
Eastern Canada the trading infrastructure it needs to keep goods moving, meet
growing demand, and diversify trade routes. It will strengthen supply chains,
create thousands of jobs, and generate approximately $140 million annually in
local and national economic benefits across Québec and Canada. Currently, the
Species at Risk Act permit has been approved and preliminary work on the
project is underway.
• 	McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project, East-Central
Saskatchewan: Situated in one of Canada’s richest mineral belts and working in
close collaboration with the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation, this project will
supply copper and zinc to strengthen Canada’s position as a global supplier of
critical minerals for clean energy, advanced manufacturing, and modern
infrastructure. It will create 400 jobs, boost local economies in Saskatchewan
and Québec, where the copper will be smelted, and is expected to be the first
net-zero copper project in Canada.
• 	Red Chris Mine expansion, Northwest British Columbia: This major expansion
project will extend the lifespan of the mine by over a decade, increase Canada’s
annual copper production by over 15 per cent, employ about 1,500 workers
during operations, with a peak of approximately 1,800 workers during
construction, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by over 70 per cent when
operational. Working in close collaboration with the Tahltan Nation, it is an
important step in reconciliation and further developing the potential of Northern
British Columbia and will strengthen Canada’s role as a reliable supplier of
copper and other resources essential for global manufacturing and clean energy
technologies. This mine is part of the proposed Northwest Critical Conservation
Corridor. This corridor is being moved to the MPO for consideration as a new
transformative strategy, as it presents opportunities for critical minerals
development, clean power transmission, Indigenous project leadership, and a
potential new conservation area the size of Greece.
Together, these projects represent investments of more than $60 billion in our
economy and will create thousands of well-paying jobs for Canadians.

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 79
Nation-Building Projects and Strategies
In addition to the first five projects, Canada’s new government also believes that
there are several strategies for projects that could be truly transformative for
this country, which are at an earlier stage and require further development:
• 	Critical Minerals Strategy: Canada can be a powerhouse in the extraction
and upgrading of critical minerals. A priority for the MPO will be to help
more critical minerals projects get to final investment decisions within a
two-year window. This will ensure that our critical minerals industry can
grow, and that Canada and our global partners can benefit from our value
chains for clean technologies and defence. These opportunities exist in
many of Canada’s regions—including Ontario’s Ring of Fire, British
Columbia’s Golden Triangle, and the Slave Geological Province in the
Northwest Territories and Nunavut.
• 	Wind West Atlantic Energy: Projects that will leverage over 60 gigawatts
of wind power potential in Nova Scotia, and more across Atlantic Canada,
connecting that renewable, emissions-free energy to Eastern and Atlantic
Canada to meet rapidly growing demand—with the potential for exports to
the Northeastern United States. The MPO will develop the regulatory

certainty that attracts private investment and sets the course for long-
term wind resources development in the Atlantic provinces. This Eastern
Energy Partnership could include important projects like interties between
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, transmission cables between Prince
Edward Island and New Brunswick, as well as Québec’s and
Newfoundland and Labrador’s further development of Churchill Falls and
Gull Island.
• 	Pathways Plus: An Alberta-based carbon capture and storage network and
pipeline project that will substantially reduce emissions with additional
energy infrastructure that will support a strong conventional energy sector
while driving down emissions from the oil sands. Pathways will facilitate low-
carbon oil exports from the Alberta oil sands to a range of markets that
demand Canadian energy.
• 	Arctic Economic and Security Corridor: A set of all-weather, dual-use, land
and port-to-port-to-port infrastructure projects that will contribute to
Canada’s defence and northern development. The project will support
Northern critical mineral projects, create new opportunities for sustainable
development, and connect communities to the rest of Canada, while
increasing capability for the Canadian Armed Forces in the North.
• 	Port of Churchill Plus: Rooted in partnership with Indigenous Peoples,
including in co-operation with Manitoba’s Crown-Indigenous Corporation,
this set of projects will upgrade the Port of Churchill and expand trade
corridors with an all-weather road, an upgraded rail line, a new energy
corridor, and marine ice-breaking capacity. The approach will prioritise
Indigenous equity ownership in developing the projects needed to turn the
Port of Churchill into a major four season and dual-use gateway for the
region. Expanded export capacity in the North through Hudson Bay will
contribute to increased and diversified trade with Europe and other
partners, while more strongly linking Churchill to the rest of Canada.
• 	Alto High-Speed Rail: Canada’s first high-speed railway, spanning
approximately 1,000 km from Toronto to Québec City and reaching speeds
of up to 300 km/hour to cut travel times in half and connect close to half of
Canada's population. This is a project that could create 51,000 jobs during
construction and inject up to $35 billion into our GDP—with a target of 25
million tonnes in emissions savings. The MPO will work to accelerate
engineering, regulatory, and permitting work to enable construction of the
project to start in four years, cutting the original eight-year timeline in half.
-- 90 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 81
The Major Projects Office represents a shift in how government will advance
regulatory approvals and coordinate financing to supercharge major project
development in Canada. The Office is drawing on public and private sector financial,
legal, regulatory, and project management experts to coordinate financing and
regulatory approvals across federal departments—acting as a streamlined “single
window” for proponents.
The Major Projects Office will also lead a review of all regulatory processes and
approvals needed to build major projects to reduce red tape and fast-track key
nation-building projects.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $213.8 million over five years, starting in
2025-26, for the Major Projects Office. Funding will also support the
Indigenous Advisory Council. Of this amount, $19.8 million will be sourced
from existing departmental resources.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $10.1 million over three years, starting in
2025-26, to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada to
continue leading the Federal Initiative on Consultation to support the
meaningful participation of Indigenous rightsholders in consultation processes
throughout the review cycle of national interest projects listed under the
Building Canada Act, including through Indigenous-led resource centres and
consultation protocols.
Further, as previously announced in August, the government is providing $40 million
over two years, starting in 2025-26, to Indigenous Services Canada through the
Strategic Partnerships Initiative to support Indigenous capacity building and
consultation on nation-building projects prior to designation under the Act.
-- 91 of 493 --

82 CHAPTER ONE
One Project, One Review
In the Speech from the Throne, the Government of Canada committed to
realising the goal of “one project, one review” by reaching cooperation
agreements under the Impact Assessment Act with every interested province and
territory within six months. On June 2, 2025, Canada’s First Ministers agreed to
“work together toward efficiently and effectively implementing ‘one project, one
review’ with the goal of a single assessment for all projects.”
Cooperation agreements will set out how federal and provincial governments will
work together on assessments of major projects, providing greater transparency
and certainty for proponents, Indigenous Peoples, and stakeholders. This will help
ensure accelerated assessments for major projects, including projects of national
interest, and signal to investors that Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial
governments are committed to working together to enable development, while
protecting Indigenous rights and the environment.
Leveraging new authorities under sections 16 and 31 of the Impact Assessment
Act, introduced in 2024, cooperation agreements can provide for substitution to a
single harmonised process that draws on the best available provincial and federal
expertise. Cooperation agreements can also allow for early assessment decisions
and full substitution to a provincial process that meets both federal and provincial
requirements. They do not affect the duty of proponents, provinces, territories,
and the federal government to fully consult with Indigenous Peoples whose rights
may be affected.
The Major Projects Office will benefit from the leadership and guidance of the
Indigenous Advisory Council (IAC)—eleven representatives from First Nations,
Inuit, Métis, and Modern Treaty and Self-Governing communities. These leaders
bring deep expertise and experience, and they will help guide the MPO’s work to
ensure that major projects create opportunities for equity ownership and
responsible resource management through meaningful participation with
Indigenous Peoples.
Meaningful consultation with Indigenous Peoples is embedded in the Building
Canada Act, both in the process of determining which projects are in our
collective interest and in the development of the conditions for those projects
going forward. To that end, in Summer 2025, the Prime Minister convened the
First Nations Major Projects Summit with over 430 First Nations leaders and
representatives, and held two similar meetings with Inuit and Métis leaders. The
-- 92 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 83
focus was to engage all Indigenous distinctions-based groups on the Building
Canada Act and how to most effectively build major projects in partnership with
Indigenous Peoples.
The government will uphold Section 35 of our Constitution and the duty to consult,
and the government’s commitment to implementing the United Nations Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including free, prior, and informed consent, as
we build Canada strong. The government will also empower and support
opportunities for proactive partnerships with Indigenous Peoples, including through
the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s Indigenous Equity Initiative, and the Indigenous
Loan Guarantee Program—which we doubled from $5 billion to $10 billion, enabling more
Indigenous communities to become owners of major projects.
Boosting Major Project Financing
The government has an ambitious agenda to build a stronger, more competitive,
and more prosperous economy by getting major projects built in Canada. Crown
corporations help incentivise and maximise private investment. For example,
Canada Growth Fund fosters clean growth investment, the Canada Infrastructure
Bank gets infrastructure projects built, and Export Development Canada helps
exporters reach new markets. These Crown corporations invest on behalf of
Canadians for the economic benefit of Canadians.
As the government embarks on its mission to maximise investment in Canada and
realise our full potential in global markets, with over $40 billion in capital ready to
invest under current authorities, Crown corporations will help bring in the
multiples of private investment that are necessary to grow our economy.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention for the Major Projects
Office to help structure and co-ordinate financing from the private sector,
provincial and territorial partners, and the federal government, including
through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, Canada Growth Fund, and the
Canada Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corporation.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to provide guidance to
Crown corporations through the application of a strategic financing framework
that will advance a unified and coordinated approach to financing across the
government’s Crown corporations, departments, and agencies. This will help
ensure that Crown corporations are prioritising nation-building projects where
possible and coordinating their support to unlock projects while delivering
value for money for taxpayers.
-- 93 of 493 --

84 CHAPTER ONE
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to amend the Canada
Infrastructure Bank Act to increase the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s statutory
capital envelope from $35 billion to $45 billion and to enable the Canada
Infrastructure Bank to make investments in any nation-building projects that
have been referred to the Major Projects Office, regardless of sector or asset
class, as long as they fall within the Bank’s legal mandate. This will unlock more
projects with the partnership of private investment.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention for the Canada Indigenous
Loan Guarantee Corporation to work with Indigenous investors on greenfield
(new build) projects that will generate economic prosperity for Indigenous
communities for generations to come.
1.2 Supercharging Growth
Unleashing economic growth and productivity is the foundation of Canadian
prosperity. To build the strongest economy in the G7, our entrepreneurs,
businesses, and researchers need the right conditions for growth. We can
supercharge Canada’s growth and global competitiveness by enhancing Canada’s
tax regime, doubling down on artificial intelligence, investing in talent, and attracting
private capital.
Productivity Super-Deduction
1. Accelerated Investment Incentive and Immediate Expensing
To boost productivity and attract investment, this new government is introducing
a Productivity Super-Deduction—a set of enhanced tax incentives covering all
new capital investment that allows businesses to write off a larger share of the
cost of these investments right away. These will also make it easier for businesses
to invest and grow.
Under this measure, companies can recover their investment cost faster through
the tax system. This makes it more attractive to invest in machinery, equipment,
technology, and other productivity-enhancing assets and improves Canada’s
competitiveness for attracting investment.
-- 94 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 85
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to move forward with
all previously announced measures that would allow businesses to write off
the cost of their investments more quickly:
◦ 	Reinstatement of the Accelerated Investment Incentive, which
provides an enhanced first-year write-off for most capital assets.
◦ 	Immediate expensing (i.e., 100-per-cent first-year write-off) of
manufacturing or processing machinery and equipment.
◦ 	Immediate expensing of clean energy generation and energy
conservation equipment, and zero-emission vehicles.
◦ 	Immediate expensing of productivity-enhancing assets, including
patents, data network infrastructure, and computers.
◦ 	Immediate expensing of capital expenditures for scientific research and
experimental development.
2. Immediate Expensing for Manufacturing and
Processing Buildings and Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances
for Low-Carbon Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities
Building on these measures, the government is making further strategic
investments in tax incentives that promote capital investment and long-term
economic growth. The new government is taking action to make Canada’s
investment environment more competitive than the U.S.
Budget 2025 proposes to introduce immediate expensing for manufacturing
or processing buildings that are acquired on or after Budget Day and that are
used for manufacturing or processing before 2030. This measure would be
phased out over a four-year period between 2030 and 2033.
The accelerated capital cost allowances (CCAs) for liquefied natural gas (LNG)
equipment and related buildings expired at the end of 2024. The measures
increased the CCA rate for liquefaction equipment from 8 per cent to 30 per cent
and for non-residential buildings used in LNG facilities from 6 per cent to 10 per
cent.
Budget 2025 proposes reinstating accelerated CCAs for LNG equipment and
related buildings, but only for low-carbon LNG facilities.
-- 95 of 493 --

86 CHAPTER ONE
To be eligible for an accelerated CCA, a facility would need to meet new high
standards of emissions performance. Two levels of support would be available,
which will depend on the emissions performance of a facility:
• 	Facilities that are in the top 25 per cent in terms of emissions performance
would be eligible for accelerated CCAs with the same rates as the previous
measures (30 per cent for liquefaction equipment and 10 per cent for non-
residential buildings used in LNG facilities).
• 	Facilities that are in the top 10 per cent in terms of emissions performance
would be eligible for accelerated CCAs of 50 per cent for liquefaction equipment
and 10 per cent for non-residential buildings used in LNG facilities.
Details regarding the new emissions performance requirements for these
additional allowances will be provided at a later date. These measures would
apply to property acquired on or after Budget Day and before 2035.
Collectively, these new and previously proposed measures form a Productivity Super-
Deduction that will accelerate the type of business investment that will drive
productivity growth in Canada.
3. Canada’s Corporate Tax Advantage
The marginal effective tax rate (METR) provides a comprehensive indicator of
how one dollar of additional business investment is taxed—a comparable indicator
of tax competitiveness across countries that considers national and sub-national
corporate tax rates, as well as investment tax credits, capital cost allowances, and
sales and capital taxes.
The productivity super-deduction will reduce Canada's METR by more than two
percentage points, strengthening our competitiveness with the U.S. following
measures implemented in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Moreover,
Canada will have the lowest METR in the G7 and below the OECD average. This
means that businesses can invest and scale more easily and that Canada will
remain an attractive destination for investment.

With the productivity super-deduction, Canada’s METRs are competitive with
those in the U.S. across most sectors, particularly in manufacturing and
processing.

policies and in some cases employ investment tax incentives of their own, which
contribute to competitiveness.
Canada’s METR is below the average of OECD countries, resulting from generous
expensing policies in Canada and lower statutory rates compared to some other
countries.
Investing Where It Counts: Catalysing Private Investment Through
Accelerated Depreciation and Immediate Expensing
Private investment in new machinery, buildings, and technology is one of the
most effective ways to increase productivity, helping workers produce more in
less time and boosting Canada’s long-term growth.
Immediate expensing and other forms of accelerated depreciation make it
easier and more attractive for businesses to invest by allowing them to deduct
the full cost of new assets more quickly. This lowers the cost of capital,
strengthens the business case for modern equipment, and encourages
companies to invest and expand in Canada.
The $2.7 billion in average annual support for investment provided through the
accelerated depreciation and immediate expensing measures included in
Budget 2025 will crowd-in private capital investment and could generate an
economic output of up to about $9 billion annually over the next ten years.
These measures would mean most assets in the manufacturing sector would be
eligible for immediate expensing—lowering the cost of capital and unlocking
billions in private investment.
Enhancing the Scientific Research and Experimental
Development Tax Incentives
Innovation and scientific discovery are the foundation of long-term economic
growth. Science fuels innovation, and innovation fuels productivity, helping
Canada stay competitive in a fast-changing global economy.
The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax incentive
program has helped Canadian businesses of all sizes conduct new and advanced
research. Small businesses have benefited the most, accounting for 64 per cent of
all claims filed and receiving roughly $1.5 billion in support in 2024-25.
-- 98 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 89
To support Canadian businesses' ability to conduct innovative research, the
government is proceeding with the following previously proposed enhancements
to the SR&ED program:
• 	Increasing the prior-year taxable capital phase-out thresholds for the SR&ED
program’s enhanced 35-per-cent tax credit.
• 	Increasing the annual expenditure limit on which the enhanced credit can be
earned, from $3 million to $4.5 million.
• 	Extending the enhanced credit to eligible Canadian public corporations.
• 	Restoring the eligibility of SR&ED capital expenditures.
To encourage investment in Canadian innovation, Budget 2025 also
proposes to further increase the annual expenditure limit on which the
SR&ED program’s enhanced credit can be earned from $4.5 million (as
previously announced) to $6 million, effective for taxation years that begin
on or after December 16, 2024.
Investing Where It Counts:
Economic Benefits of Supporting R&D
Investments in research and development (R&D) are known to improve firm
performance. Firms undertaking R&D to innovate consistently achieve higher
productivity growth, and these benefits are amplified for firms making
complementary investments in other technologies or adopting better business
strategies. Firms conducting R&D are also more likely to enter export markets.
The benefits of R&D are not limited to within firms. Studies have documented
broad benefits from R&D that spread across the economy.
The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax
incentive program, already providing $4.2 billion in annual support, is the
federal government’s single most important tool to encourage business R&D.
Budget 2025 confirms the implementation of previously announced SR&ED
enhancements and proposes to further increase the enhanced rate
expenditure limit, to help innovative businesses scale up and grow. This
additional government investment of $440 million on an ongoing basis is
expected to catalyse private sector R&D investment, generating an economic
output of $1.2 billion a year—about a three-time return for Canada’s
economy. These enhancements are on top of revamping the SR&ED
administration process—providing businesses with greater certainty and speed
when making investment and R&D decisions.
-- 99 of 493 --

90 CHAPTER ONE
The government has listened to innovators and builders that a burdensome
administrative process for applying to the SR&ED program has limited its impact in
driving investment in Canada. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will implement
transformational reforms to the administration of the SR&ED program. The
reforms will provide businesses with greater confidence to invest in R&D projects,
enhancing Canada’s innovation strategy.
Budget 2025 announces, to improve predictability and streamline
administration of the SR&ED program, the government’s intention for
the CRA to:
◦ 	Implement an elective pre-claim approval process to provide businesses
with an up-front technical approval of their eligible SR&ED projects,
before businesses undertake any work or incur costs. For claims
submitted through this elective process that require an expenditure
review, processing time will be cut in half to 90 days from 180 days.
◦ 	Increase the use of artificial intelligence in the program’s administration,
which will enable the CRA to avoid subjecting low risk claims to
unnecessary audit interventions, allowing them to be processed faster.
◦ 	Streamline the review process by eliminating unnecessary steps and
reducing burdensome information requirements that can delay the final
determination of claims.
These improvements do not carry a fiscal cost and will be implemented into
SR&ED program operations as of April 1, 2026.
Additionally, the CRA intends to engage in targeted consultations to further
improve the administration of the SR&ED program, including by reviewing the
SR&ED claim form (Form T661).

92 CHAPTER ONE
Seizing the Full Potential of Artificial Intelligence
The transformative nature of artificial intelligence (AI) can create opportunities for
millions of Canadians, businesses, and the economy. Budget 2025 helps Canada
build necessary AI compute infrastructure, including the development of a
Sovereign Canadian Cloud. This will help businesses seize the opportunities from
AI, creating new jobs and economic growth.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $925.6 million over five years, starting in
2025-26, to support a large-scale sovereign public AI infrastructure that will
boost AI compute availability and support access to sovereign AI compute
capacity for public and private research. The investment will ensure Canada has
the capacity needed to be globally competitive in a secure and sovereign
environment. Of this amount, $800 million will be sourced from funds
previously provisioned in the fiscal framework.
Budget 2025 announces that the Minister of Artificial Intelligence and Digital
Innovation will engage with industry to identify new promising AI infrastructure
projects and enter into Memoranda of Understanding with those projects.
Budget 2025 also announces the government’s intention to enable the Canada
Infrastructure Bank to invest in AI infrastructure projects.
Understanding the broader effects of AI is also essential, helping to guide our efforts
to maximise its benefits.
Budget 2025 proposes to allocate $25 million over six years, starting in 2025-
26, and $4.5 million ongoing for Statistics Canada to implement the Artificial
Intelligence and Technology Measurement Program (TechStat). TechStat will
use data and insights to measure how AI is used by organisations, and
understand its impact on Canadian society, the labour force, and the economy.
This amount will be fully sourced from existing departmental resources.
The government will also explore options for the National Research Council of
Canada’s Canadian Photonics Fabrication Centre to best position it to attract
private capital, scale its operations, and serve as a platform for Canadian
innovation and new photonic applications, including in the face of the rise of AI
and related compute infrastructure.
-- 102 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 93
Investing Where It Counts:
Economic Benefits of AI and Quantum
AI has the potential to revolutionise business processes in all manner of
industries, allowing for increased automation and significant increases in
productivity. The OECD estimates that adoption of AI adoption could raise
productivity growth by 1.1 percentage points annually over the next 10 years.
Quantum is a similarly transformative technology: computing problems that are
currently considered to be intractable even with the most powerful classical
computers could be solved using quantum computers, including in such areas as
cybersecurity, finance, and logistics.
Countries that lead in game-changing technologies such as these can unlock
significant economic benefits through commercialising the associated intellectual
property and being among the first to put it to use.
With an investment of $925.6 million over five years to build a large-scale
sovereign compute capacity, Budget 2025 is providing AI infrastructure to
further support sovereign AI capacity in Canada and ensure a successful
Canadian AI ecosystem. Budget 2025 also proposes to provide, through the
Defence Industrial Strategy, $334.3 million over five years to strengthen
Canada’s quantum ecosystem.
This fall, the government launched consultations to inform the next chapter of
Canada's AI leadership and will develop a new AI strategy by the end of 2025.
The government will also consider whether new AI incentives and supports
should be provided.
-- 103 of 493 --

94 CHAPTER ONE
Protecting Canadian Intellectual Property
Intellectual property output and ownership is central to Canada’s innovation
agenda. Clear pathways to generate and retain intellectual property in Canada and
transparency in the intellectual property system are essential to Canada’s
innovators and academic community.
To ensure Canada’s innovation ecosystem is equipped to protect Canadian
intellectual property, and support Canadian SMEs to commercialise and leverage
their intangible assets to compete in the global marketplace:
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $84.4 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to
extend the Elevate IP program, as well as $22.5 million over three years,
starting in 2026-27, to renew support for the Innovation Asset Collective’s
Patent Collective.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $75 million over three years, starting in
2026-27, to the National Research Council to extend the IP Assist Program.
To further strengthen the intellectual property ecosystem in Canada, the
government will conduct an intellectual property performance review to
identify new ways to partner with emerging and scaling intellectual property-
intensive firms, increase domestic investment in leading and high-potential
firms, retain and commercialise intellectual property in Canada, and help firms
to protect and commercialise their intellectual property in foreign markets to
advance trade diversification.
Finally, the government is committed to improving legal certainty and transparency
in the intellectual property system to help facilitate more intellectual property-
backed lending and limit abusive behaviour.
Investing to Build High-Growth Companies and
Emerging Fund Managers
Investing in Canada’s venture capital sector is essential to empowering
entrepreneurs with the capital and networks they need to launch and scale
resilient, high-impact companies. These venture funds drive innovation and are
shaping the next generation of Canadian anchor firms and fund managers that will
support economic growth and strengthen Canada’s economic resilience.
-- 104 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 95
To better align with emerging priorities, Budget 2025 proposes to realign
previous venture capital and mid-cap commitments to support access to capital
that meets current market needs.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $1 billion on a cash basis over three years,
starting in 2026-27, for the Business Development Bank of Canada to launch
the new Venture and Growth Capital Catalyst Initiative, a fund-of-funds that
would leverage more private venture capital by incentivising pension funds
and other institutional investor participation. The initiative will also support
new and emerging fund managers and important sectors such as the life
sciences sector.
Strategic investment is essential to bolster innovation and drive long-term
growth. Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to develop a
strategy to support Canadian firms facing early growth-stage funding gaps,
and proposes to provide $750 million, on a cash basis, in support of those
firms. Details on the strategy will be announced in 2026.
2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan
Throughout Canada’s history, we have welcomed people from around the world—
those fleeing persecution, war and strife, those seeking to work hard and build a
better life for their families, those seeking to study at our world-class universities,
experts wanting to drive innovation in Canada. The fabric of our nation is woven
with this tradition.
As we have welcomed the world, we had the promise that if someone came to
Canada they would contribute to our prosperity, and in return they would get all
Canada offered—a country that is generous, fair, and diverse.
Our immigration system was built to standardise and evaluate newcomers so that
admission was based on a person’s merits. Over time, this system has evolved—its
complexity has grown and its efficiency has waned. In recent years, the system
became even harder to manage and less functional, and the pace of arrivals began
to exceed Canada’s capacity to absorb and support newcomers in the way we are
used to doing.
In 2018, 3.3 per cent of Canada’s population were temporary residents. By 2024,
that number had more than doubled to 7.5 per cent, an unprecedented rate of
growth that put pressure on housing supply, the healthcare system, and schools.
Canada’s new government recognises that this system is no longer sustainable,
and we are determined to make it so, for everyone who lives in and comes to
this country.
-- 105 of 493 --

96 CHAPTER ONE
We are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a
trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels—allowing us to fulfill the
promise of Canada to those who call it home. At the same time, Canada will
continue its long tradition of welcoming those fleeing violence, persecution and
displacement.
The results of the government’s focus are already becoming apparent. Asylum
claims are down by a third, and new temporary foreign worker arrivals are down
by approximately 50 per cent this year. New international student arrivals have
also declined by approximately 60 per cent compared to 2024. This is a start, but
we recognise there is more work to do.
Budget 2025 announces that the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will
stabilise permanent resident admission targets at 380,000 per year for three
years, down from 395,000 in 2025, while increasing the share of economic
migrants from 59 per cent to 64 per cent. The new plan will also reduce the
target for new temporary resident admissions from 673,650 in 2025 to
385,000 in 2026, and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. The fiscal cost of this
measure is $168.2 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, and
$35.7 million ongoing. These costs primarily represent the net loss in fee
revenue, driven by fewer temporary resident admissions.
◦ 	The government recognises the role temporary foreign workers play in
some sectors of the economy and in some parts of the country. To that
end, the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will consider industries and
sectors impacted by tariffs and the unique needs of rural and remote
communities.
In addition, Budget 2025 proposes a one-time initiative to recognise eligible
Protected Persons in Canada as permanent residents over the next two
years. This practical step is a reflection of the fact that the vast majority of
these people cannot return to the country of their origin. It will also ensure
that those in genuine need of Canada’s protection have their permanent
status recognized, accelerating their full integration into the Canadian
society and their path to citizenship. The fiscal cost of this measure is $120.4
million over four years, starting in 2026-27. This represents the costs for
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border
Services Agency to process the additional applications, which are partially
offset by higher fee revenues.
-- 106 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 97
Budget 2025 also proposes to undertake a one-time measure to accelerate the
transition of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent residency in 2026
and 2027. These workers have established strong roots in their communities,
are paying taxes, and are helping to build the strong economy Canada needs.
The fiscal cost of this measure is $19.4 million over four years, starting in
2026-27. This also represents the costs for Immigration, Refugees and
Citizenship Canada and other departments to process the additional
applications, which are partially offset by higher fee revenues.
These targets keep permanent resident arrivals at less than one per cent of the
population beyond 2027 and will reduce the total number of temporary residents
to less than five per cent of Canada’s population by the end of 2027.
Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system,
while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our
economy.
Additional details on the 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan will be provided
when the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship tables the 2025
Annual Report to Parliament on Immigration.

Improving Foreign Credential Recognition
Many newcomers to Canada already have extensive training in sectors where we
are experiencing labour shortages, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare
professionals. However, many face challenges in getting their training and
experience recognised in Canada. Over half of immigrants with a bachelor’s
degree or higher are overqualified for their jobs, which is costing Canada’s
economy billions of dollars every year.
Improvements to foreign credential recognition are essential to ensure that
immigration can effectively help address labour shortages and support the
Canadians that rely on goods and services from those sectors.
As announced on October 27, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to provide
$97 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, to Employment and Social
Development Canada to establish the Foreign Credential Recognition Action
Fund to work with the provinces and territories to improve the fairness,
transparency, timeliness, and consistency of foreign credential recognition, with a
focus on health and construction sectors. This funding will be sourced from
existing departmental resources.
-- 108 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 99
Recruiting International Talent
A resilient Canadian economy depends on a highly skilled workforce. Immigration
helps fill critical labour gaps in priority industries where there is not enough
domestic talent.
The International Talent Attraction Strategy and Action Plan will position the
immigration system to meet strategic labour market needs, ensuring Canada has
the talent required to drive innovation and growth in our strategic industries,
while respecting immigration targets to ensure a sustainable immigration rate.
As an early measure, the government proposes a targeted, one-time initiative to
recruit over a thousand highly qualified international researchers to Canada. The
expertise of these researchers will help advance our global competitiveness and
contribute to the economy of the future. To contribute to research excellence in
Canada, Budget 2025 proposes to provide up to $1.7 billion for a suite of
recruitment measures:
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $1 billion over 13 years, starting in 2025-26,
to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council, and Canadian Institutes of Health Research to
launch an accelerated research Chairs initiative to recruit exceptional
international researchers to Canadian universities.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $400 million over seven years, starting in
2025-26, to the Canada Foundation for Innovation to establish a
complementary stream of research infrastructure support to ensure these
recruited Chairs have the equipment they need to conduct research in Canada.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $133.6 million over three years, starting in
2026-27, to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council, and Canadian Institutes of Health
Research to enable top international doctoral students and post-doctoral
fellows to relocate to Canada.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide up to $120 million over 12 years, starting in
2026-27, to the granting councils to support universities’ recruitment of
international assistant professors, as appropriate.
Additional details on the launch of recruitment processes will be announced in the
coming weeks.
-- 109 of 493 --

100 CHAPTER ONE
The government will also examine whether Canada’s research ecosystem requires
further support to retain talent, and work to implement the capstone research
organisation as announced in Budget 2024. In addition, reflecting the
foundational importance of research and innovation to growing the Canadian
economy, the Comprehensive Expenditure Review savings targets for the three
granting councils will be adjusted to two per cent.
To strengthen Canada's innovation ecosystem, address labour shortages and
attract top talent in healthcare, research, advanced industries and other key
sectors, in the coming months the government will also launch an accelerated
pathway for H1-B visa holders.
Catalysing Investment in Airports and Ports
Canada’s new government is taking action to catalyse investment in our airports
and ports—so that we build transportation infrastructure that can meet growing
demand, encourage more tourism into Canada, bring down travel costs for
Canadians, and help diversify our trade to the rest of the world. Airports and ports
are central to diversifying Canada’s trade. They connect our economy to the world:
around 20 per cent of Canada’s exports and 23 per cent of imports pass through
ports. Airports support high-value cargo exports, such as fish and lobster exported
to Asia.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to unlock more of the
economic potential of Canada's airports and consider new ways to attract
private sector investment, including by negotiating lease extensions with
airport authorities, enabling more economic development activities on airport
lands, and examining the existing airport ground lease rent formulas. The
government’s objective is to ensure the long-term sustainability and
competitiveness of Canada’s airports. Investing in Canada’s airports delivers
cross-sectoral benefits, from enhancing safety and transportation, improving
affordability for Canadians, strengthening regional access and connectivity, and
driving trade and economic growth. The government will also consider options
for the privatisation of airports.
-- 110 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 101
Budget 2025 also proposes to provide $55.2 million over four years,
starting in 2026-27, with $72.5 million in remaining amortisation, and
$15.7 million ongoing thereafter, to Transport Canada to support safety-
related infrastructure projects and upgrades, including those that support
dual-use priorities, at local and regional airports. Funding will be delivered
through the Airports Capital Assistance Program, and will also support a
priority project to extend the runway at the Transport Canada-owned Îles-
de-la-Madeleine Airport.
The government will also continue to examine and engage with investors on
opportunities to cultivate more private investment at marine ports.
Generational Infrastructure Investments
The federal government is making significant investments in infrastructure,
including trade and transportation infrastructure, public infrastructure like roads,
bridges, water, and public transit, as well as other infrastructure. New and
upgraded infrastructure helps businesses run more smoothly, makes it easier for
people to get to work, and supports new jobs. All of this helps the economy grow
and become more productive. Planned federal infrastructure investments are
expected to reach $115.2 billion over the next five years.
Chart 1.3 – Planned Investments in Building Canada
Upcoming Federal Expenditure on Infrastructure – 5-Year Horizon
(billions of dollars, accrual)
-- 111 of 493 --

102 CHAPTER ONE
Communities and regions across Canada are facing high costs to improve and
expand important infrastructure. These upgrades are needed to support growing
populations and replace aging systems. Improving infrastructure can unlock
greater productivity and expand trade opportunities for Canada, and can also
play a key role in addressing the housing shortage and creating more homes for
Canadians.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to launch a new Build
Communities Strong Fund, to be administered by Housing, Infrastructure and
Communities Canada, and proposes to provide $51.0 billion over 10 years,
starting in 2026-27, and $3.0 billion per year ongoing in new and existing
funding for this initiative, including through funding to provincial and
territorial governments—and through them to municipalities—to support a
wide range of infrastructure projects and help our local communities build
Canada strong.
These projects will grow a stronger economy and create thousands of good
jobs and federal project selection will consider factors such as use of
unionised labour, and use of Community Employment Benefits agreements.
The program would be comprised of three streams:
◦ 	A Provincial and Territorial Stream that will provide $17.2 billion over
10 years, starting in 2026-27, to support provincial and territorial
infrastructure projects and priorities. Funding will support housing-
enabling infrastructure (e.g., roads, water/wastewater), health-related
infrastructure (e.g., hospitals), and infrastructure at colleges and
universities. To access funds, provinces and territories must agree to cost-
match federal funding and to substantially reduce development charges
and not levy other taxes that hinder the housing supply.
◦ 	Of the above amount, $5 billion over three years, starting in 2026-27,
will be dedicated for a Health Infrastructure Fund. This fund will
complement existing health-related support provided to provinces and
territories by helping to ensure their health infrastructure, such as
hospitals, emergency rooms, urgent care centres, and medical schools,
will be able to respond to the health care needs of Canadians.
Recognising the critical need to strengthen health infrastructure
across the country, the requirement related to development charges
and other taxes noted above will not apply to this fund.
◦ 	A Direct Delivery Stream, delivered by Housing, Infrastructure and
Communities Canada, that will provide $6 billion over 10 years, starting in
2026-27, to support regionally significant projects, large building retrofits,
-- 112 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 103
climate adaptation, and community infrastructure. Proponents of
regionally significant projects would be required to seek private sector
investment, including private investment leveraged through Canada
Infrastructure Bank financing, before being eligible for funding under this
stream.
◦ 	The existing Canada Community-Building Fund will be rebranded as the
initiative’s Community Stream. This stream will, as planned, provide
$27.8 billion over 10 years, starting in 2026-27, and $3.0 billion per year
ongoing to support local infrastructure projects.
◦ 	Funding for the Build Communities Strong Fund includes repurposed
resources from the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund.
As examples of projects that will help build strong communities with improved
local infrastructure, Budget 2025 announces support for the following projects:
◦ 	Filipino Community and Cultural Centre in Metro Vancouver, British
Columbia;
◦ 	White Rock Pier in White Rock, British Columbia;
◦ 	Newton Athletic Park Artificial Turf, Practice Field, Tennis Court, and
Walking Path in Surrey, British Columbia;
◦ 	Royal Athletic Park in Victoria, British Columbia;
◦ 	Rapid Fire Theatre in Edmonton, Alberta;
◦ 	Bissell Centre in Edmonton, Alberta;
◦ 	Lac La Ronge Indian Band – Kitsaki Hall in La Ronge, Saskatchewan;
◦ 	RCMP Heritage Centre in Regina, Saskatchewan;
◦ 	Riverview Community Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba;
◦ 	Dakota Community Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba;
◦ 	Victims of Flight PS752 Memorial in Unity Park in Richmond Hill, Ontario;
◦ 	Hamilton Downtown Family YMCA in Hamilton, Ontario;
◦ 	Bob MacQuarrie Recreation Complex in Orleans, Ontario;
◦ 	Toronto Metropolitan University Medical School in Brampton, Ontario;
◦ 	Exploramer Shark Pavilion in Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, Quebec;
◦ 	L’Espace Hubert-Reeves in Charlevoix, Quebec;
◦ 	Chantier Naval Forillon in Gaspé, Quebec;
◦ 	Centre sportif de Montreal-Nord in Montreal, Quebec;
◦ 	Place Marcel-François-Richard in Ville de Beaurivage, New Brunswick;
◦ 	SeaRoots Alliance Wellness Centre in Souris, Prince Edward Island;
-- 113 of 493 --

104 CHAPTER ONE
◦ 	Breakwater Installation in Petty Harbour-Maddox Cove, Newfoundland
and Labrador;
◦ 	Baddeck Recreation Facility in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, and;
◦ 	Inuit Nunangat University
Funding for these projects will be sourced from the Direct Delivery stream of the
Build Communities Strong Fund or from other existing federal programs, where
appropriate. Further details, including final commitments, on each project will be
shared in the coming months.
1.3 Canada’s Climate
Competitiveness Strategy
Climate action is not just a moral obligation—it’s an economic necessity. The
world economy is undergoing a historic transformation towards low-carbon
energy and clean technology. In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached
USD $2 trillion—nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels—and the
global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035. On the other hand,
the Canadian Climate Institute estimates that climate disruption, if left unchecked,
could cut median Canadian household income by nearly 20 per cent by the end of
the century, disrupting many elements of the economy, from food supply chains
to financial markets.
To compete internationally, Canada will need to reduce its carbon intensity to
meet the growing demand from global markets for products with low associated
greenhouse gas emissions. Buyers of Canada’s resources—oil and gas, steel, and
aluminum—are increasingly looking for low-carbon sourcing. Fortunately, Canada
is well positioned to take advantage of these new growth opportunities. For
example, our electricity grid, one of the cleanest in the world, guarantees access
to the clean power businesses around the world are looking for, in sectors ranging
from aluminum to steel to AI. In conventional energy too, Canada is one of very
few large-scale suppliers committed to strong environmental, social, and
governance standards, and we have reduced the emission intensity of overall oil
production by 8 per cent, and the emission intensity of oil sands operations by
almost 40 per cent between 1990 and 2022.

106 CHAPTER ONE
Lowering our emissions is critical to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s
oil and gas and steel sectors. Reducing emissions is not only essential for
environmental reasons, but also a key factor in securing access to markets that
prioritise sustainability. By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean
energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and expand its exports,
particularly in sectors where low-carbon solutions are increasingly seen as a
requirement rather than a bonus.
Canada’s natural resources, workforce, and commitment to fighting climate
change position us to surpass economies that fail to adapt. We will build new
infrastructure and capitalise on projects that further Canada’s standing as a clean
energy superpower. We will explore initiatives such as nuclear energy, electricity
grid interties, and investments in low-carbon fuels such as hydrogen, renewable
energy projects, high-speed rail, and critical mineral development.
As the new government moves decisively to build major nation-building projects
and millions more homes, we are doing so while reducing emissions and growing
our economy. Our investments in clean growth technologies will propel Canada’s
competitive advantage. For example, the Darlington New Nuclear Project will
support the construction of small nuclear reactors, while LNG Canada Phase 2 will
supply cleaner energy compared to other LNG facilities worldwide. We will
continue to prioritise clean growth and climate objectives as new projects are
considered.
Budget 2025 outlines the new government’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy,
creating the conditions for the investment needed to build an affordable net-zero
future in which Canadian businesses are well-positioned to compete and succeed
in the global economy.
The strategy is a central pillar of the government’s plan for Canada to become the
strongest economy in the G7. It is based on driving investment, not on
prohibitions, and on results, not objectives. It aims to maximise carbon value for
money, prioritising measures that will result in the greatest emissions reductions
and competitiveness benefits at the lowest cost for Canadians.
Strengthening Industrial Carbon Pricing
An effective industrial carbon pricing system, underpinned by a long-term price
trajectory, is essential to providing certainty to businesses looking to invest and
compete internationally.
-- 116 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 107
Industrial carbon pricing drives investment to reduce emissions and build the
competitiveness of Canadian business. It is expected to deliver more emission
reductions than any other policy, with negligible impacts on affordability for
Canadians.
However, carbon markets are not functioning as well as they should be. The
government will improve the effectiveness of carbon markets to provide
confidence that credit prices will be predictable and sufficient to support clean
growth investments without adversely affecting competitiveness or leading to
carbon leakage.
Improving the effectiveness of industrial carbon pricing will ensure every dollar
spent delivers maximum impact. Industrial carbon pricing rewards innovation and
spurs investment in cleaner technologies—helping Canada’s industrial sectors to
grow and compete.
To improve the effectiveness of Canada's industrial carbon pricing system, the
government will take the following actions:
• 	Develop a post-2030 carbon pricing trajectory: The government will engage
provincial and territorial (PT) governments in setting a multi-decade industrial
carbon price trajectory that targets net-zero by 2050. Setting a long-term
trajectory will allow businesses to make investment decisions with confidence
now and into the future. Securing pan-Canadian agreement on this trajectory
will increase certainty.
• 	Fix the benchmark and improve the backstop: The government will improve its
application of the benchmark—the tool that ensures all PT industrial pricing
systems are harmonised across the country in providing a common, strong price
signal. The government will promptly and transparently apply the federal
backstop whenever a PT system falls below the benchmark. The government
will engage with PT governments about improvements to the benchmark and to
PT pricing systems such as harmonising or linking carbon credit markets.
• 	Carbon contracts for difference: Canada Growth Fund will continue to issue
contracts as a means of further improving future carbon price certainty for
investors making large, long-duration capital investments.
Clarity on Greenhouse Gas Regulations
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increase the Earth’s temperature, causing
climate change and its associated effects—extreme weather events, intense
wildfires, and rising sea levels. Canada has been working to reduce its emissions,
and from 2005 to 2023, Canada's GHG emissions decreased by 8.5 per cent—
even as our population grew from 32 to 40 million and our GDP expanded by 38
-- 117 of 493 --

108 CHAPTER ONE
per cent. As we transition to a net-zero economy, Canada’s new government is
committed to reducing GHG emissions.
Buyers of Canada’s resources are increasingly demanding they be sourced and
produced in a way that reduces emissions and promotes sustainability. Reducing
our emissions will make our industries more competitive and gives them an
advantage in the global economy.
The government will take the following approach to ensure its regulations
complement industrial pricing:
• 	Electricity: The transition to net-zero by 2050 will require clean, reliable power.
The Clean Electricity Regulations will aim to reduce emissions to protect the
environment and human health from the threat of climate change. The
government will work with provinces and territories to advance these goals and
ensure that Canada’s grid is clean as electricity demand grows.
To enable long-term agreements with provinces and territories, Budget 2025
announces the government’s intention to propose legislative amendments to
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
• 	Methane: Methane emissions are potent greenhouse gas emissions that are not
effectively covered by carbon pricing. The government will finalise enhanced
methane regulations for the oil and gas sector and landfills, and intends to work
with provinces and territories to negotiate equivalency agreements as
appropriate.
• 	Update on the Oil and Gas Emissions Cap: Canada is committed to bringing down
the emissions associated with the production of oil and gas. Effective carbon
markets, enhanced oil and gas methane regulations, and the deployment at scale
of technologies such as carbon capture and storage would create the
circumstances whereby the oil and gas emissions cap would no longer be
required as it would have marginal value in reducing emissions.
• 	Electric Vehicles: In September, the government announced its intent to make
targeted regulatory adjustments to help the automotive sector stay competitive
during a period of upheaval and uncertainty in response to immediate challenges
from U.S. trade and policy actions. This included the initial step of removing the
2026 target from the Electric Vehicle Availability Standard and launching a 60-
day review of the overall regulation. Following this review, the government will
announce next steps on electric vehicles in the coming weeks.
• 	Clean Fuel: Targeted updates to the Clean Fuel Regulations will help reduce
reliance on imported fuels, strengthen domestic supply chains, and support jobs
in agriculture, forestry, and waste sectors.
-- 118 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 109
Boosting Clean Economy Investment Through Tax Credits
A substantial increase in energy supply is required to support the growth of
Canada’s population and economy. In Canada, a major driver of this demand
growth will come from several large, energy-intensive economic sectors as they
expand and electrify, including manufacturing, pulp and paper, oil and gas
extraction, and metal and non-metallic mineral product manufacturing sectors,
including steel and aluminum, and emerging drivers such as AI data centres and
electric transportation.
To meet this growing demand for clean energy, Canada will need to modernise its
electrical grids. To achieve this, we will attract significant new investments to the
sector, enabling infrastructure upgrades, energy storage, and new technologies,
while also expanding wind and solar investments. Expanding interprovincial
interties can also lower costs while ensuring grid reliability. The degree of
investment needed in that timeframe will be significant. Forecasts indicate that
the annual pace of investment needs to nearly triple from current levels to meet
anticipated future demand.
To seize the investment opportunities from this, the government has now
delivered four of its clean economy investment tax credits. These are now
available to be claimed with the Canada Revenue Agency and investors are
starting to avail themselves of those tax credits.
• 	The refundable investment tax credits available include the:
◦ 	37.5 to 60-per-cent Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage investment
tax credit, available as of January 1, 2022.
◦ 	30-per-cent Clean Technology investment tax credit, available as of
March 28, 2023.
◦ 	15 to 40-per-cent Clean Hydrogen investment tax credit, available as of
March 28, 2023.
◦ 	30-per-cent Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit,
available as of January 1, 2024.
With these investment tax credits now set out in law, businesses can move
forward with the certainty they need to make final investment decisions to invest
and build in Canada.
The government will soon be introducing legislation to deliver the Clean
Electricity investment tax credit and enhancements to the investment tax credits
-- 119 of 493 --

110 CHAPTER ONE
that have already been implemented. While legislation progresses, investors
already have the certainty of retroactive eligibility:
• 	The Clean Electricity investment tax credit would be available as of
April 16, 2024, for projects that did not begin construction before
March 28, 2023.
• 	Expanded eligibility to include systems that produce electricity, heat, or both
electricity and heat from waste biomass and changed the eligibility requirements
for small nuclear energy property under the Clean Technology investment tax
credit, both measures would be available retroactively as of November 21,
2023, and March 28, 2023, respectively.
• 	Expanded eligibility to include qualifying equipment used in eligible polymetallic
mining projects under the Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax
credit would be retroactively available as of January 1, 2024.
• 	Expanded eligibility to include hydrogen produced from methane pyrolysis
under the Clean Hydrogen investment tax credit would be available as of
December 16, 2024.
Delivering on Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits
Building on these existing measures, the government is announcing further changes
to the clean economy investment tax credits to ensure that they remain competitive
and effective in attracting projects and high-paying careers to Canada.
Budget 2025 confirms the government’s intention to proceed with the
implementation of the Clean Electricity investment tax credit and proposes to
-- 120 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 111
remove the conditions imposed on provincial and territorial governments for
their Crown corporations to be eligible. Removing the conditions will ensure
that provincial and territorial Crown corporations can access the investment
tax credit and effectively and efficiently support clean electricity investment
while reducing administrative burden.
Budget 2025 proposes to extend, by five years, the availability of the full credit
rates for the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) investment tax
credit, that would apply from 2031 to 2035. Credit rates would remain
unchanged from 2036 to 2040.
Budget 2025 proposes to expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the
Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit to include antimony,
indium, gallium, germanium, and scandium, in order to support investments
in the extraction, processing, and recycling of co-product and by-product
critical minerals.
The government will also consult on the possibility of introducing a domestic
content requirement under the Clean Technology and Clean Electricity investment
tax credits.
Supporting Critical Mineral Projects
Critical minerals are used to build modern technology, and Canada is rich in these
resources. Canada’s new government is making it easier and more affordable for
businesses to mine for critical minerals—supporting local industries and developing
domestic and global value chains. To that end, at this year’s G7 Summit in
Kananaskis, Alberta, the Prime Minister introduced the Critical Minerals Production
Alliance—a Canadian-led initiative that leverages trusted international partnerships
to enhance critical mineral supply chains for collective defence and advanced
technology. As part of the work of the Alliance, on October 31, 2025, the
Government of Canada announced new investments, partnerships and measures to
accelerate and unlock critical minerals projects essential in defence, clean energy
and advanced manufacturing supply chains, including entering into offtake
agreements with two critical minerals projects in Canada.
Critical minerals are an important part of Canada’s Climate Competitiveness
Strategy, as essential resources are needed for clean energy technologies and
renewable energy infrastructure, including solar panels, electric vehicle batteries,
and energy storage systems.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $2 billion over five years, on a cash basis,
-- 121 of 493 --

112 CHAPTER ONE
starting in 2026-27, to Natural Resources Canada to create the Critical
Minerals Sovereign Fund. The fund will make strategic investments in critical
minerals projects and companies, including equity investments, loan
guarantees, and offtake agreements. Budget 2025 also proposes to provide
$50 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, to Natural Resources Canada
to support the delivery of this fund.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $371.8 million over four years, starting
in 2026-27, to Natural Resources Canada to create the First and Last Mile Fund.
This new fund would support the development of critical minerals projects and
supply chains at the upstream and midstream segments of value chains, with a
focus on getting near-term projects into production. The First and
Last Mile Fund would absorb the Critical Minerals Infrastructure Fund and
leverage its existing funding envelope to provide up to $1.5 billion in support
through 2029-30. The fund would also continue to support clean energy and
transportation infrastructure projects related to critical minerals development.
Budget 2025 proposes to expand eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration
Tax Credit (CMETC) to include an additional 12 critical minerals necessary for
defence, semiconductors, energy, and clean technologies: bismuth, cesium,
chromium, fluorspar, germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium,
tantalum, tin, and tungsten. The expansion of the CMETC would apply to
certain exploration expenditures targeted at these minerals and renounced as
part of a flow-through share agreement entered into after Budget Day and on
or before March 31, 2027.
Mobilising Capital for Transition to Net-Zero
Canada has the resources and talent to develop technology that can deliver low-
carbon energy. As the global demand for low-carbon goods and processes rises,
Canada’s new government is seizing this opportunity by mobilising public and
private capital that promotes investment in sustainability.
To accelerate the flow of private capital into sustainable activities across priority
economic sectors:
Budget 2025 reconfirms the government’s support for the arm’s length
development of made-in-Canada sustainable investment guidelines (also
known as a taxonomy) by the end of 2026. These investment guidelines will
become an important, voluntary tool for investors, lenders, and other
stakeholders navigating the global race to net-zero, by credibly identifying
“green” and “transition” investments. The government will select and announce,
-- 122 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 113
by the end of 2025, an external organisation with the expertise to develop the
sustainable investment guidelines.
To finance government spending that helps industrial and agricultural sectors
get cleaner and more competitive, Budget 2025 announces the government’s
intention to explore the development of a Sustainable Bond Framework that
would allow for the issuance of both green and transition bonds to be aligned
with a Canadian taxonomy, and to expand the Framework to incorporate
economic sectors as the taxonomy is being developed.
Budget 2025 announces that the government will work with provinces and
territories to improve climate disclosure across the economy. This work will
seek alignment with international standards and harmonised rules across
federal-provincial-territorial jurisdictions.
Updating Greenwashing Legislation
The Competition Act was recently amended to create new enforcement provisions
for false claims of environmental benefit. These “greenwashing” provisions are
creating investment uncertainty and having the opposite of the desired effect with
some parties slowing or reversing efforts to protect the environment.
To provide more certainty to the marketplace, Budget 2025 announces the
government's intention to propose legislative amendments to remove
some aspects of these provisions, while maintaining protections against false
claims.
Supporting the Implementation of the Climate
Competitiveness Strategy
Canada is committed to building a competitive, low-carbon economy and to
continue to drive down industrial emissions-intensity, including in the energy sector.
To demonstrate that commitment, the government will report on its progress.
To support the implementation of this strategy, the government will develop
and communicate new metrics to show how companies and households are
reducing their carbon footprint, how the clean economy is growing, and how
exports are tracking to achieve world-leading emissions intensity.
-- 123 of 493 --

114 CHAPTER ONE
1.4 Increasing Competition
Competition is central to productivity, innovation, and affordability. When
businesses face healthy competitive pressures, they operate more efficiently, cut
costs, and innovate to stay ahead of rivals. These benefits are passed on to
Canadians through lower prices, better product quality, and more choice. In various
sectors, such as telecoms, a lack of competition has led to far too high prices for
Canadians. The new government is increasing competition to bring down costs for
Canadians, helping keep more money in your pockets. Budget 2025 will launch
some of the most ambitious, pro-competitive measures for Canada in a generation.
Increasing Competition in Canada’s Telecom Sector
Canada’s telecom sector has experienced a lack of competition, which has led to
higher cellphone bills compared to other countries. Canada’s new government is
increasing competition in the telecom sector to lower costs for Canadians.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to boost competition,
innovation, and productivity through various measures, namely:
◦ 	Pursuing a new “dig once” policy approach to nation-building projects to
encourage coordinated installation of fibre optic lines as part of the
development of major projects of national significance.
◦ 	Reducing regulatory burden required to deploy telecommunications
infrastructure across the country, including by consulting on a streamlined
tower-siting process later this year.
◦ 	Ensuring that industry has access to quality spectrum, including by
releasing additional spectrum, consulting on a modernised Spectrum
Licence Transfer Framework in late 2025-26, and continuing to use the
streamlined framework for residual spectrum auctions established
in 2021.
◦ 	Working alongside the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission to implement the pro-consumer
amendments to the Telecommunications Act announced in Budget 2024
that will allow Canadians to more easily renew or switch between home
internet, home phone, and cell phone plans.
◦ 	The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission’s
ongoing efforts to implement the government’s policy direction to
enhance and protect the rights of consumers and to implement new rates
for access to wholesale internet services and wireless roaming.
-- 124 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 115
Over the past years, previous measures have also been taken to boost
competition in the telecom sector:
• 	Lowering telecom prices by issuing a new directive in 2023 for the Canadian
Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to improve competition,
make it easier to cancel services, and strengthen the protections Canadians
have from unfair business practices, such as paying unlocking fees for their
cell phone.
• 	Investigating international mobile roaming charges through a Canadian Radio-
television and Telecommunications Commission study, to ensure the cell phone
fees Canadians pay are fair and affordable.
• 	Amending the Competition Act to strengthen its ability to address longstanding
competition issues and to reflect the new realities of the technology-
driven economy.
A More Competitive and Innovative Financial System
Budget 2025 is announcing the first phase of a plan to foster greater competition,
innovation, and efficiency in the Canadian financial sector. This will lower banking
costs for Canadians while providing more banking options. Over the coming
months, the government will continue to work and engage with experts and
stakeholders to inform further actions to support a competitive financial sector.
-- 125 of 493 --

116 CHAPTER ONE
The government’s plan will include action in four key areas:
1. Unlocking Capital
Capital markets and financial institutions have a key role to play to ensure that
Canadian companies and projects can access capital and grow the economy.
They create investment opportunities, drive innovation, support job growth, and
strengthen retirement savings. Canadian companies need access to capital in Canada
to grow and thrive, building prosperity for all Canadians.
• 	The government has concluded negotiations and has reached an agreement in
principle with provinces and territories on a Financial Services chapter for the
Canada Free Trade Agreement, which will promote an efficient, open, and sound
financial services sector within Canada.
• 	The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has recently
announced a number of steps to provide clarity in capital planning for Canada’s
regulated financial institutions, as well as to look at opportunities to ease entry
and reduce regulatory burden, including:
◦ 	Engaging with small- and medium-size lenders about changes to capital
requirements that will enable them to compete more effectively.
◦ 	Consulting on ways to encourage business lending by banks in support of
the economy through the capital treatment of certain types of loans.
◦ 	Reducing capital requirements for Canadian infrastructure debt and equity
investments made by federally regulated life insurers.
Budget 2025 proposes to catalyse investment by insurers and financial
institutions by repealing the limits on borrowing and portfolio investments in
the financial institutions statutes and replacing them with more flexible
guidance from the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
Capital markets are essential to fund the initiatives critical to Canada’s
economic prosperity and growth potential. Over the coming year, the
government will continue to explore other opportunities to support capital
markets and financial institutions to deploy capital towards Canadian
companies and projects that will grow the economy.
2. Increasing Competition in the Banking Sector
To improve choice and lower costs for consumers, Budget 2025 proposes
measures to help Canadians switch between financial institutions and to increase
fee transparency:
-- 126 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 117
Budget 2025 announces that the government intends to publish draft
regulations by spring 2026 to prohibit investment and registered account
transfer fees, currently costing Canadians on average $150 per account.
The government will also require the timely transfer of these accounts and
clear presentation of information on the process and lack of fees.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to explore improving the
transparency of cross-border transfer fees, including foreign exchange costs for
banks, as non-transparent pricing is causing consumers to pay more than
expected to send their money internationally.
Budget 2025 announces that the government intends to work with banks on
ways to simplify the process of switching primary chequing accounts to other
Canadian financial institutions.
The government has requested the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada to prepare
a report on the structure, level, and transparency of fees charged by Canadian banks.
These measures complement recent government efforts to reduce banking fees for
Canadians. In 2024, the government negotiated an updated low-cost and no-cost
account commitment with banks, including all Big Six banks, which offers more debit
transactions for consumers for no more than $4 per month, or at no cost for certain
groups. Also in 2024, the government capped non-sufficient fund fees to $10, set to
take effect in March 2026, saving Canadians upwards of $600M annually.
Small- and medium-sized banks, as well as provincial and federal credit unions, are
critical for consumer choice across Canada. To help smaller financial institutions
invest, scale, and compete, Budget 2025 proposes measures to support their
unique needs:
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Bank Act and the Canada Deposit
Insurance Corporation Act to make it easier for federal credit unions to achieve
scale and for provincial credit unions to enter the federal framework.
Budget 2025 proposes legislative amendments to raise the 35 per cent
public holding requirement threshold from $2 billion to $4 billion—allowing
small financial institutions to grow larger before having to change their
ownership structure.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to work with banks to
develop a voluntary code of conduct to strengthen smaller financial
institutions’ access to distribution channels for brokered deposits.
-- 127 of 493 --

118 CHAPTER ONE
3. Supporting Innovation and Global Competitiveness
Advancements in technology have given consumers more payment options. To
keep payments fast, flexible, and secure, the government launched its payments
modernisation plan. In September 2025, the government achieved two major
milestones in the plan, advancing its commitment to deliver more secure
innovative payments for Canadians.
• 	Close to 1,500 payment service providers are now supervised by the Bank of
Canada under Canada’s Retail Payment Activities Act, ensuring they meet
regulatory requirements to manage risks and protect end-user funds.
• 	New entities, such as registered and supervised payment service providers, can
now apply to become members of Payments Canada and participate directly in
national payment systems, including the forthcoming Real-Time Rail payment
system.
Next steps in the government’s plan to support innovation in the financial sector
include implementing new legislative frameworks to allow responsible innovation
to flourish.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s commitment to advancing open
banking by introducing legislation to complete the Consumer-Driven Banking
Act, and provide a data-mobility right in the Personal Information Protection and
Electronic Documents Act to facilitate economy-wide data sharing.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to delegate oversight of
the Consumer-Driven Banking Act to the Bank of Canada, building on its
oversight activities of payment service providers. The Bank of Canada will
retain up to $19.3 million over two years on a cash basis from its remittances
to the Consolidated Revenue Fund to support implementation. The remaining
funding that had been previously allocated to the Financial Consumer Agency
of Canada in the 2024 Fall Economic Statement will not be spent, amounting to
$36.9 million over two years.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $25.7 million over five years, beginning in
2025-26, and $5 million ongoing, for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to support national security
safeguards in the Consumer-Driven Banking Act.
-- 128 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 119
Budget 2025 further announces that the government will accelerate the
next phase of consumer-driven banking, including legislating the ability to
direct actions, such as switching accounts or making bill payments, or
“write access,” by mid-2027, once Canada’s Real-Time-Rail project is live
and in widespread use.
Budget 2025 reaffirms the government’s support for the launch of Canada’s
nation-building payments infrastructure, the Real-Time-Rail, in 2026. This
payments system will enable money to move instantly between accounts,
eliminating wait times and enabling innovative new use-cases for payments.
Budget 2025 also announces the government’s intention to introduce
legislation to regulate the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins in Canada.
◦ 	This legislation will require issuers to maintain and manage adequate asset
reserves, establish redemption policies, implement risk management
frameworks, and protect the sensitive and personal information of
Canadians. The legislation will also include national security safeguards to
support the integrity of the framework so that fiat-backed stablecoins are
safe and secure for consumers and businesses to use.
◦ 	To administer the relevant legislation, the Bank of Canada will retain
$10 million over two years, starting in 2026-27, from its remittances to
the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Administrative costs in subsequent years
are projected to be $5 million per year and will be offset from stablecoin
issuers regulated under the Act.
◦ 	Related amendments to the Retail Payment Activities Act will also be made
to enable the regulation of payment service providers that carry out
payment functions using prescribed stablecoins.
The government will also explore options and work with the private sector to
encourage the adoption of artificial intelligence in the financial sector in ways that
advance innovation and build trust in its use.

120 CHAPTER ONE
Transforming the Payments Experience for Canadians
Payments are at the heart of Canada’s financial system and are essential to a
strong, modern, and well-functioning economy. Budget 2025 takes important
steps in modernising how consumers and businesses can send, spend, and
receive money—making payments safer, faster, and more convenient
for everyone.
Safer payments: Since September 8, 2025, the Bank of Canada is supervising
close to 1,500 payment service providers, ensuring Canadians can continue to
have confidence in using their services.
More choice for Canadians: On September 25, 2025, the government
expanded membership eligibility in Payments Canada to allow new firms to
apply for direct participation in Canada’s core payment systems, providing
Canadians with more choice on providers of financial services.
Faster payments: Payments Canada’s Real-Time Rail, a new fast payments
system launching in 2026, will enable Canadians and businesses to send and
receive money instantly, any time, any day.
Consumer-Driven Banking: Budget 2025 introduces the next phase of
consumer-driven banking, with a commitment to extend the framework to
include payment initiation by mid-2027—making it faster and easier to pay
directly from your bank account in another app.
Stablecoins: Budget 2025 introduces a new federal framework to regulate
the issuance of fiat-backed stablecoins, making them safer for Canadians and
businesses and helping build trust in digital payments.
Transparent international remittance pricing: The government intends to
introduce new transparency requirements for banks for cross-border
transfers, including associated foreign exchange costs, ensuring Canadians
can easily compare pricing before completing a transaction.
Resolving misdirected payments: The government intends to introduce new
requirements for banks to investigate and attempt to resolve transfers
accidentally sent to the wrong recipient.
4. Simplifying the Regulatory and Legislative Environment
The government will undertake work to streamline and simplify regulation in the
-- 130 of 493 --

BUILDING A STRONGER CANADIAN ECONOMY 121
financial sector, to ensure Canada’s regulatory environment remains efficient and
supports innovation.
As a first step, Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to make
federal financial sector consultations more predictable and transparent for
stakeholders through better coordination and communication among federal
financial regulators and the Department of Finance Canada and by sharing how
the potential impacts of new requirements have been considered.
Going forward, the Department of Finance will work with agencies with regulatory
responsibilities over the financial sector to seek ways to reduce red tape and the
regulatory burden on financial institutions and unlock more private capital.
Restricting Non-Compete Agreements
Competitive labour markets foster innovation and productivity. However, non-
compete agreements that prevent workers from moving to rivals or starting a
competing business reduces competition and undermines the efficiency of the
labour market. Restricting the use of non-compete agreements will protect
workers’ rights, promote labour mobility, strengthen competition, and empower
workers to move to a higher-paying job or start their own business.
Budget 2025 announces that the government intends to amend the Canada
Labour Code to restrict the use of non-compete agreements in employment
contracts for federally regulated businesses. The government will launch
consultations on proposed legislative changes in early 2026.
-- 131 of 493 --

122 CHAPTER ONE
Gender and Diversity Impacts Spotlight
Budget 2025 will support First Nations, Métis, and Inuit by:
• 	Building the capacity of Indigenous communities to participate in Crown
consultation processes through the Federal Initiative on Consultation.
This will help ensure the perspectives, rights, and interests of First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit are reflected throughout major project planning
and decision making. Effective Crown-Indigenous consultations increase
certainty for all parties and will create a clearer path for Indigenous
communities to shape and benefit from projects of national interest.
Budget 2025 prioritises financial well-being for lower-income
populations by:
• 	Advancing Consumer-Driven Banking. Lower-income and financially
stressed households are expected to benefit most through access to
lower-cost products, clearer choices, and tools to manage debt and
reduce financial stress.
For more information on the expected impacts of Budget 2025 measures
on these and other diverse groups of Canadians, please see Annex 6.

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE
TO RESILIENCE
2.1 Protecting Canada’s Strategic Industries
2.2 Growing Canada’s Trade with the World
-- 137 of 493 --


-- 138 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 129
The global trade landscape is rapidly changing, shaped by growing geopolitical
tensions and persistent unfair trade practices. Amid these shifts, the United
States is fundamentally transforming all of its trade relationships. The effective
U.S. tariff rate is now the highest it has been since the Great Depression in the
1930s, and these tariffs are being applied to all countries and nearly all goods.
Canada has the best deal of any U.S. trading partner—85 per cent of trade with
the U.S. is now tariff free and we have the lowest average tariff of any country
in the world. Yet, we cannot rely on our most important trade relationship as we
once did.
The changes in the U.S. policy go beyond tariffs. Countries must now buy access
to the world’s largest economy through investments, unilateral trade
liberalisation, and policy changes in their home markets.
All the while, the transformation of global trade is occurring against a backdrop
of wide economic disruptions: geopolitical realignment, AI and technological
transformations, and a shift to a low-carbon economy.
The effect is profound—hurting companies, displacing workers, disrupting
supply chains, forcing companies to rethink where they source their materials
and products, and causing uncertainty that is curbing investment.
This disruption calls for a new, bold approach. Given we cannot control what
other nations do, Canada’s new government is focused on what we can control:
building our strength at home. Canada will invest in domestic production,
Canadian expertise, and diversifying trade with reliable economic partners. This
is how we will meet the challenges of our times: through a strong and resilient
Canadian industrial base.
Our new industrial strategy will transform our economy—from one that is overly
reliant on a single trading partner, to one that is more resilient to global shocks.
A new economy built on the solid foundation of Canadian industries and
bolstered by diverse international trade partners.
-- 139 of 493 --

130 CHAPTER TWO
2.1 Protecting Canada’s Strategic Industries
In order to protect, retool, and support the largest industrial pivot in a
generation, Canada’s new government introduced a series of new, strategic
measures for workers and businesses in those sectors most impacted by U.S.
tariffs and trade disruptions—from the auto industry, to steel and aluminum,
to forestry and agriculture. Canada has also adopted a series of protective
measures—including counter tariffs—in order to safeguard Canadian workers
and businesses. These initiatives will help workers acquire new skills and
businesses retool their production and diversify their products, while spurring
more domestic demand for Canadian businesses. As we build the economy of
the future, we are ensuring workers and industries can seize its opportunities.
These new measures will help give industries and workers the tools they need
to build a better future. With economic uncertainty creating a challenging
investment environment in Canada, the time to act is now. That’s why the
government is stepping in with the most comprehensive suite of trade
resilience measures in Canadian history. By supporting our workers and
industries, we will build Canada strong.
Protecting Workers and Transforming Canada’s
Strategic Industries
Canada’s new government is building a new industrial strategy to meet this
moment. This will transform our economy—from one of reliance on specific trade
partners to one that is more resilient to global shocks.
Given the urgency of the moment, the government has announced a series of
new measures to protect workers and businesses in sectors most impacted by
U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions. During this time of uncertainty, Canada’s new
government is supporting our auto workers and agricultural producers,
manufacturers, and other workers who have felt the effects of trade tensions.
As set out below, over $25 billion has been announced for supports for workers
and businesses, with an expected cost of over $12 billion on an accrual basis
over five years, starting in 2025-26. The government also expects $4.4 billion in
tariff revenue. These measures will help give industries and workers the tools
they need to build a more resilient Canadian economy.
-- 140 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 131
1. Support for Agriculture, Fish, and Seafood
Canada is one of the largest exporters of agriculture, fish, and seafood in the
world, and these sectors contribute to Canada’s competitiveness, sustainability,
and food security. The Canadian agricultural sector is a symbol of the country’s
ingenuity, resilience, and ability to move up the value chain. Together with the
fish and seafood sectors, it plays a vital role in supporting jobs and growth
across the country and in rural communities. With clear standards for labelling
food products, the government helps customers choose Canada. The
government is helping these sectors adapt and respond to economic challenges
and a shifting trade environment, while positioning them to take advantage of
new opportunities. The government has committed more than $639 million over
five years, starting in 2025-26, for the following measures:
• 	$109.2 million in 2025-26 to Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for the
federal-provincial-territorial cost-shared AgriStability program, to increase
the compensation rate for agricultural producers from 80 to 90 per cent,
along with raising the payment cap per farm from $3 million to $6 million.
This is available to help agricultural producers cope with large declines in
farming income due to increased costs, adverse market conditions, and
other challenges.
• 	$75 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, to Agriculture and Agri-
Food Canada for the AgriMarketing Program to enhance the
diversification and promotion of Canada’s agriculture, agri-food, fish, and
seafood products into new markets.
• 	$97.5 million over two years, starting in 2025-26, to temporarily increase
the Advance Payments Program’s interest-free limit to $500,000 for
canola advances for the 2025 and 2026 program years, together with the
temporary increase to $250,000 of the interest-free limit for all producers
for the 2025 program year, which will result in interest savings for
producers while increasing access to cash flow to help cover costs until
they sell their products.
• 	$372 million over two years, starting in 2026-27, to Natural Resources
Canada to establish a Biofuels Production Incentive to support the
stability and resiliency of domestic producers of biodiesel and renewable
diesel, of which $175.2 million will be repurposed from the Clean Fuels
Fund; and the intention to make targeted amendments to the Clean Fuel
Regulations to support the domestic biofuels industry.
-- 141 of 493 --

132 CHAPTER TWO
In addition, Farm Credit Canada launched the Trade Disruption Customer
Support Program in March 2025 to make available $1 billion in new lending to
help reduce financial barriers for the Canadian agriculture and food industry.
2. Support for Forestry
The government is helping the forestry and softwood lumber sector transform
to remain competitive. These measures will help unlock the full potential of the
industry to keep pace with increased housing and major infrastructure
construction.
• 	Up to $700 million over two years on a cash basis, starting 2025-26, in
loan guarantees administered by the Business Development Bank of
Canada, to help ensure companies have the financing and credit support
they need to maintain and restructure their operations during this period
of transformation.
• 	$500 million over three years on a cash basis, starting in 2026-27, to renew
and expand existing Natural Resources Canada’s forestry programs focused
on market and product diversification (including new export initiatives). It
also includes a commitment to prioritise Canadian materials in construction
and changing federal procurement processes to require companies
contracting with the federal government to source Canadian lumber.
3. Equipping Companies for Growth and Diversification
Canada’s new government is helping companies overcome immediate trade
pressures and providing them with support to pivot, grow, or diversify their
operations by supporting projects to deepen their reach within Canada and find
new reliable markets abroad.
• 	$5 billion over six years, starting in 2025-26, for the Strategic Response
Fund, a new program with flexible terms to help firms in all sectors and
regions impacted by tariffs to adapt, diversify, and grow. The program will
seek to maintain industrial capacity by offsetting new market access costs,
supporting retooling, and helping Canada-based firms to expand or secure
new markets. This includes $1 billion in Strategic Innovation Fund support
for the steel industry's transition toward new lines of business and
strengthening domestic supply chains announced in July 2025.
-- 142 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 133
• 	Up to $1 billion over three years, starting in 2025-26, to the Regional
Development Agencies for the Regional Tariff Response Initiative to
support businesses impacted by tariffs across all affected sectors,
including increasing non-repayable contributions for eligible businesses.
4. Supporting Workers
The government is implementing a new reskilling package for workers, has made
Employment Insurance more flexible and with extended benefits, and will launch
a new digital jobs and training platform with private-sector partners to connect
Canadians more quickly to careers.
• 	$570 million over three years, starting in 2025-26, through Labour
Market Development Agreements with provinces and territories to
support training and employment assistance for workers impacted by
tariffs and global market shifts.
• 	$382.9 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, and $56.1 million
ongoing, to launch new Workforce Alliances to bring together employers,
unions, and industry groups to work on ways to help businesses and
workers succeed in the changing labour market and coordinate public and
private investments in skills development. A new Workforce Innovation
Fund will invest in projects tailored to local job markets to help businesses
in key sectors and regions recruit and retain the workforce they need.
• 	Temporary flexibilities to the Employment Insurance Work-Sharing
program, as announced on March 7, 2025, to provide EI benefits to
eligible employees who agree to work reduced hours due to a decrease in
business activity beyond their employer’s control. This helps employers
and employees avoid layoffs while supplementing reduced income with EI
benefits. This measure is expected to cost $370.5 million over five years,
starting in 2025-26, and $18.5 million ongoing.
• 	Temporary Employment Insurance measures that enhance income
supports for Canadian workers whose jobs have been impacted by the
economic uncertainty caused by foreign tariffs. These supports are
expected to cost $3.7 billion over three years, starting in 2025-26.
• 	$50 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, and $8 million ongoing,
to implement a new digital tool to facilitate job search and applications,
and launch a national online training platform in partnership with the
private sector.
-- 143 of 493 --

134 CHAPTER TWO
5. Ensuring Access to Financing
The government has also introduced liquidity measures to support small,
medium, and large Canadian businesses. These measures include:
• 	Launching the Large Enterprise Tariff Loan (LETL) facility, a $10 billion
financing facility designed to support otherwise successful Canadian firms
negatively affected by actual or potential tariffs and countermeasures. The
Canada Enterprise Emergency Funding Corporation (CEEFC) announced
its first LETL loan to Algoma Steel Inc., which will provide Algoma with
access to $400 million in liquidity, with the Government of Ontario
contributing an additional $100 million under the same terms to help
stabilise a major Canadian player in the competitive steel industry, amid
current disruptions to the global steel trade.
• 	Enhancing the Business Development Bank of Canada’s $500 million
Pivot to Grow program to provide support to eligible small- and medium-
sized steel enterprises facing liquidity challenges. This program will cost
$231 million on an accrual basis over five years starting in 2025-26.
• 	$940 million in 2025-26 for the deferral of corporate income tax
payments and GST/HST remittances due to the Canada Revenue Agency
from April 2 to June 30, 2025, providing up to $40 billion in liquidity
support for Canadian businesses.
Becoming Our Own Best Customer
To build our strength at home, we have to focus on what we can control. We
can control who we buy from, and we choose to buy Canadian. The government
is launching a new Buy Canadian Policy—moving from “best efforts” to a clear
obligation to buy Canadian. When domestic suppliers are not available,
purchases will be required to include Canadian content or be sourced from
trusted partners. Such cases will remain the exception, not the norm, and will
require ministerial approval. To facilitate the implementation of the Buy
Canadian Policy, the government will also implement regulatory amendments to
ensure that Buy Canadian aspects of federal procurement processes are not
subject to review by the Canadian International Trade Tribunal.
This new approach will extend to all federal agencies and Crown corporations,
like VIA Rail and Alto, which is responsible for the new High-Speed Rail
initiative, leveraging every public dollar to strengthen Canada’s economy, create
jobs, and building capacity at home. The policy will also cut red tape and make it
-- 144 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 135
easier for Canadian businesses to access federal procurement opportunities.
This policy will ensure that federal procurement will also support Canadian
social enterprises.
To support this policy, the federal government will also set up a Small and
Medium Business Procurement Program to help Canadian small- and medium-
sized enterprises access federal procurement opportunities.
Canada’s new government is on a mission to build Canada strong through major
infrastructure projects, a modern defence industry, and millions more homes.
Through the new Buy Canadian Policy, we are making government a force for
nation-building—becoming our own best customer, protecting Canadian
businesses, and empowering our workers with high-paying careers that build
prosperity at home.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $98.2 million over five years, starting in
2026-27, and $9.8 million ongoing to Public Services and Procurement
Canada and $7.7 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to the
Treasury Board Secretariat to support the implementation of the new Buy
Canadian Policy.
Budget 2025 also proposes to provide $79.9 million over five years, starting
in 2026-27, to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to
support the new Small and Medium Business Procurement Program.
Investing Where It Counts: Resilient Canadian Power Through
the Darlington New Nuclear Project
Canada will be the first G7 country to bring small modular reactor (SMR)
power online, helping to drive innovation, jobs, and industrial growth. At full
potential of four SMRs, the Darlington New Nuclear Project in Bowmanville,
Ontario, will provide 1,200 megawatts of clean, reliable electricity, the
equivalent of around 1.2 million homes.
The project was made possible through a federal and provincial commitment
to invest in a stronger, more resilient Canada. The project is also an example
of securing broader benefits to the Canadian economy, with an estimated 80
per cent of small modular reactor construction to occur in Ontario.
As announced on October 23, 2025, financial support includes a $2 billion
investment from the Canada Growth Fund, along with an additional $1 billion
investment from the province of Ontario, through the Building Ontario Fund.

Trade with the World
Chart 2.1 – Doubling exports of goods and services to non-U.S.

A New Trade Infrastructure Strategy
As Canada deepens its trade relationships with reliable partners, we will need to
build the infrastructure that will advance our goal of doubling non-U.S. exports
over a decade, generating $300 billion more in trade. To that end, Budget 2025
includes a suite of new supports for trade and transportation infrastructure
projects. These new initiatives will be supported by the Canada Infrastructure
Bank in assessing projects and determining the appropriate mix of
government supports.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $5.0 billion over seven years, starting in
2025-26, to Transport Canada to create the Trade Diversification Corridors
Fund. By investing in the infrastructure that moves our products to global
markets, this fund will strengthen supply chains, unlock new export
opportunities, and build a more resilient, diversified economy. The Fund will
support projects of all scales, including digital infrastructure, to improve the
ability of our imports and exports to travel efficiently across the country and
to and from the rest of the world. For example, the government will consider
investments in key projects in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Region, at ports
in northeastern Québec like enhancing the Port of Saguenay’s capacity to
build a second wharf, rail lines in Alberta, port and rail infrastructure on the
West Coast, and more.

• 	As part of additional resources for Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
announced on October 17, 2025, CBSA will work with Public Safety,
Transport Canada, and Global Affairs Canada to identify additional ports
for container import and export designation, particularly in the Great
Lakes-St Lawrence Region, like Québec City and Hamilton. This will help
catalyse private investment at ports and is essential to diversifying our
trade.
We must also protect our sovereignty in the North and connect northern
communities to domestic and global markets. While increasing trade opportunities
and improving defence readiness, investments in northern transportation
infrastructure can improve the lives of northern residents, including for First
Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, through new connections to Canada’s
economy and transportation network.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $1 billion over four years, starting in
2025-26, to Transport Canada to create the Arctic Infrastructure Fund,
which will invest in major transportation projects in the North with dual-
use applications for civilian and military use, including airports, seaports,
all-season roads, and highways. These investments will strengthen
Canada’s sovereignty, support economic development and job creation in
Northern communities, advance Indigenous economic reconciliation, and
promote further trade diversification by opening new gateways to
global markets. Dual use infrastructure investments in the North will
reliably meet both military and local needs, and the government
recognizes that Inuit, First Nations, and other communities are best
placed to identify community needs.
-- 147 of 493 --

138 CHAPTER TWO
To facilitate the Arctic Infrastructure Fund’s support for northern projects,
Budget 2025 also proposes to provide $25.5 million over four years, starting
in 2025-26, to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada,
and $41.7 million over four years, starting in 2025-26, to Canadian Northern
Economic Development Agency, to help accelerate regulatory processes in
Canada’s North—including consultation with Indigenous governments and
organisations, and local northern communities. Canada is an Arctic nation.
Indigenous partnerships are critical to Canada’s sovereignty and security
related investments.
Investing Where It Counts: Infrastructure to Diversify Trade
Improving Canada’s transportation network strengthens economic resilience and
supports trade diversification. Canada is a trading nation with trade totaling
approximately two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). However, Canada’s
trade remains heavily concentrated with a single partner: the United States. At
the same time, Canada has significant untapped potential to diversify its trade.
While Canada’s trade deal with the United States and Mexico gives preferential
access to about 28 per cent of the global economy, its network of other trade
agreements extends that reach to around 66 per cent, including every other
G7 country.
-- 148 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 139
Canada holds a comparative advantage not only in primary sectors—such as
agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, and oil and gas—but also across a range of
manufacturing industries, including wood, paper, transportation equipment,
aerospace, food and beverage, and primary metals. This is in addition to a thriving
services, technology and value-added goods trade—the economy of the future.
Unlocking this potential requires targeted, forward-looking investments in trade
infrastructure that allow goods to move efficiently, avoiding bottlenecks. To
enable this investment, Budget 2025 proposes to invest $6 billion in Canadian
transportation infrastructure, which could raise productivity and increase
Canadian GDP by up to $21 billion.
Beyond facilitating access to international markets for Canadian companies
affected by trade disruptions, these investments will benefit the broader
economy by connecting markets, enabling businesses and industries to expand,
all while creating jobs and ensuring Canadians have access to alternative suppliers
when trade is disrupted. By improving the efficiency and resilience of Canada’s
transportation network, trade infrastructure investment directly supports both
economic growth and strategic trade diversification.
Growing and Diversifying Canada’s Trade
1. Export Development Canada’s Support for Trade
Diversification: Growing Business by $25 billion
The measures proposed in Budget 2025 expand on recent initiatives brought
forward to help Canadian exporters reach new markets, including Export
Development Canada (EDC)’s two-year, $5 billion Trade Impact Program, which
launched in March 2025 and offers a range of export tools including trade credit
insurance, export guarantees, and foreign exchange guarantees. Across virtually
all sectors, companies are facing increased uncertainty and costs, and EDC
continues to actively engage with customers and industry stakeholders to better
understand their needs and to determine how to best support them.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention for EDC to increase
total business facilitated by $25 billion by 2030. This will help expand
Canada’s exports and trade development activities in sectors of strategic
importance for Canada, including in critical minerals, energy, clean
technology, infrastructure, and defence.
-- 149 of 493 --

140 CHAPTER TWO
2. Strengthening Ties in the Indo-Pacific and Europe
Canada’s path to long-term economic resilience hinges on diversifying our exports.
This means doing more business across the world—particularly in growth-markets—
to increase overall trade volumes, move beyond traditional north-south trade
patterns, and strengthen our collaboration with reliable trading partners and Allies
around the world. In particular, the government will focus its efforts on the Indo-
Pacific—a pivotal source of long-term demand—and in Europe, where businesses
can take advantage of established export links, a similar business culture, shared
geopolitical interests, and emerging sectoral opportunities.
Despite a more expansive free trade network than any other G7 country, offering
access to about two thirds of the global economy, 70 per cent of Canadian
exports remained concentrated in the U.S. as of 2024, with only 4 per cent
directed to CETA markets and 8 per cent to CPTPP countries. Recent survey data
from EDC shows that goods exporters are continuing to prioritise North American
and advanced European markets for expansion, with economies in Asia notably
absent from their plans.
Canada enters this period of trade transformation in a highly favourable
position—the first G7 country with free trade agreements with all of its G7
partners. Demand is high and will remain at this level for many of the goods we
produce in abundance, including energy, potash and other critical minerals, agri-
food, and related products—as well as value-added goods, services, and
technology. And we are similarly well-placed as an investment destination. In
exchange, partnerships with foreign firms can offer Canadian businesses new
footholds in global supply chains.
The government is committed to equipping Canadian businesses to compete
globally in sectors where we are traditionally strong, as well as in new markets
for new advanced technologies that will shape the economies of the future.
This renewed effort, supported by over $1.7 billion in new investments, forms a
key part of Canada’s new comprehensive industrial strategy for building the
strongest economy in the G7.

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 141
Leveraging Strategic Opportunities
in the Indo-Pacific Region
Agriculture and Agri-
Food
The Indo-Pacific region is a critical market for Canadian
agriculture. Our agri-food products and innovation can help the
region’s population and growing middle-class meet its food and
nutrition needs.
Clean Technology 	Canadian capital, expertise, and cleantech innovations are in
demand as Asia seeks to urbanise and industrialise in a
sustainable manner. There are significant opportunities to export
our nuclear technology.
Energy and
Infrastructure
Countries across the Indo-Pacific are making infrastructure
investments to support economic growth, power digital
transformation, provide new services, and address climate
change. We can help provide energy security to key partners in
the region.
Advanced
Manufacturing
The region is fast to adopt new technologies for manufacturing
and digital transformation which creates opportunities for
Canadian innovation.
Service Exports 	Digital services are Canada’s fastest growing export category.
There are significant export opportunities for digital service
exports in Indonesia, Japan, and the Philippines.
-- 151 of 493 --

142 CHAPTER TWO
Leveraging Strategic Opportunities
in Europe
Agriculture and Agri-
Food
European farming and agriculture are changing, and sectors such as
artificial intelligence and nanotech are assuming an increasing role in
industry, which is opening a rich source of business opportunities.
Clean Technology 	Countries throughout Europe have strong demand for Canadian
clean technology and energy products. In 2025, the European Union
(EU) released a roadmap to fully end dependency on Russian energy
imports while providing affordable alternatives for citizens and
industry.
Continental Defence
and Ukrainian
Reconstruction
There are opportunities for Canadian firms to support increased
European defence spending, while Ukraine’s reconstruction needs
could total $1 trillion, and Canadian businesses can benefit from
enormous opportunities across nearly every sector, from
engineering and energy to agri-food, health care, and technology.
Minerals and Metals Canada-EU cooperation on critical minerals offers strategic
opportunities for Canada’s mining sector. As the top western
producer of aluminum, nickel, and platinum, and a source of copper,
Canada has the potential to bring a significant amount of critical
minerals into production, supporting the EU’s electrification,
decarbonisation, and national security.
Service Exports 	Canada’s post-pandemic growth in service exports has outshone
that of many advanced economies, and Europe is Canada’s second
largest service export market, behind the United States.
-- 152 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 143
To seize these opportunities, Budget 2025 proposes a step change, and a series
of new measures to help Canadian enterprises compete and succeed
internationally. These include concessional financing to open doors in priority
markets, more financial support to help businesses explore international
partnerships, and digitalisation and infrastructure investments to position
Canada as a fast, reliable supplier of choice to the region.
3. Trade Diversification Strategy
Canada is setting a new goal to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade,
generating $300 billion more in trade—that’s an increase of over $100 billion in
5 years. To do this, Canada must focus on growing areas of key competitive
advantage and supercharging engagement with the world’s fastest growing
markets.
• 	New Strategic Exports Office: Canada’s competitors are increasingly
fusing traditional diplomacy with commercial acumen to help their
businesses and workers win opportunities abroad. To coordinate
engagement across all departments and Government of Canada tools, a
new Strategic Exports Office at Global Affairs Canada will curate a
pipeline of international business opportunities and build sophisticated,
proactive roadmaps for Canadian senior-level engagement to open doors
and remove roadblocks for Canadian companies. This Office will operate
with resolve and laser-focus to remove longstanding trade irritants,
market access barriers, infrastructure gaps, and financing needs.
4. Making New Business-to-Business Connections in Europe
Building on recent and continuing efforts in the Indo-Pacific region, the
government will launch a series of new initiatives to showcase the talent and
competitiveness of Canadian enterprises in European markets.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $8 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $2 million ongoing, to Global Affairs Canada to deepen trade
relations with European partners by undertaking new trade missions with
Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian Chambers of Commerce
in Europe.
-- 153 of 493 --

144 CHAPTER TWO
Helping Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Abroad
Québec City’s WaterShed Monitoring Inc’s international success is a great
Canadian small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) success story. With the help
of Canada’s Trade Commissioner Service (TCS), the water management
company has grown and expanded in European countries, maintaining a
corporate office in France. It is now pursuing opportunities in the Indo-Pacific
region, with company representatives joining a Team Canada Trade Mission to
Malaysia and Vietnam in March 2024 and taking part in the TCS’ first South-East
Asia Watertech Canadian Technology Accelerator in Singapore.
5. Removing Barriers and Modernising Trade
In addition to opening up access to new, high-growth markets, ongoing trade
negotiations play an essential role in lowering the barriers businesses face under
existing agreements. This includes important efforts to modernise rules that
support trade in the rapidly expanding digital services sector.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $20 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $4.8 million ongoing, to enhance Global Affairs Canada’s
capacity to negotiate and implement trade and investment-
related agreements.
Connecting Canadian Businesses to the Global Market
1. Seizing International Opportunities Through Trade Finance
For over 80 years, EDC has helped exporters to finance deals, offset the risks of
doing business abroad, and access new markets. The government is committed to
ensuring EDC’s toolkit fits the needs of Canadian exporters and supports resilience
and growth in the current trade context.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention for EDC to launch a
$2 billion concessional trade finance envelope, on a cash basis, to encourage
international partners to buy Canadian. This new financial tool will help
exporters in key sectors—such as infrastructure and clean technology—to
engage in projects in some of the world’s fastest-growing developing
economies, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, and to participate in the
reconstruction of Ukraine’s critical infrastructure. This will be funded from
EDC’s existing capital envelope and Global Affairs Canada’s existing
departmental resources.
-- 154 of 493 --

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 145
2. Backing for Businesses Exploring New Markets
Financial supports and specialised advisory services help businesses grow
internationally by enabling them to manage important upfront investments,
such as travel, distribution and agent fees, product licensing, and hiring staff. A
range of supports are available through specialised federal entities, and are
often complemented by provincial or territorial programs.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $68.5 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, with $19.9 million ongoing, to Global Affairs Canada to enhance
CanExport, which encourages small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
national industry associations, and innovators to diversify their exports to
new markets abroad by sharing the costs of international business
development activities, such as legal expenses, trade shows, and market
research. Of this amount, $14.6 million over four years starting in 2026-27
and $2.6 million ongoing will be repurposed from existing resources.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $7.6 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, with $2.1 million ongoing to Global Affairs Canada to support
Canadian companies through the Innovation Partnership Program and the
Canadian Technology Accelerator. The Innovation Partnership Program
helps Canadian companies scale up their exports through international
partnerships, and the Canadian Technology Accelerator helps Canadian
technology companies access international markets and export
opportunities. Of this amount, $1.9 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $0.6 million ongoing will be repurposed from
existing resources.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $46.5 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada for the
SME Export Readiness Initiative, to support training for SMEs with limited
exporting experience to build capacity to make informed, strategic decisions
as they diversify trade. This will help Canadian firms access and be
successful in new international markets and increase economic resilience.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $4.2 million over three years, starting in
2027-28, and $1.4 million ongoing to Natural Resources Canada to maintain
capacity to promote nuclear energy exports and strategic engagement in key
export markets.
-- 155 of 493 --

146 CHAPTER TWO
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $39.9 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $11.1 million ongoing to the National Research Council of
Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program to expand the Clean
Technology Demonstration initiative to global markets.
Increasing Food Exports
Canada’s agricultural producers and fish and seafood harvesters are known around
the world for the quality, safety, and sustainability of their products, from canola to
seafood to beef. Recent trade tensions and retaliatory measures have created
challenges for these key sectors, and the government continues to stand behind
them in defending fair, rules-based trade. With global demand for high-quality,
nutritious food and plant protein on the rise, Canada is ready to meet the moment:
expanding agriculture and agri-food, fish, and seafood exports, adding more value
at home, and making export processes faster, more efficient, and more digital to
help agriculture producers, harvesters, and processors reach new markets.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $76 million over five years, starting in
2026-27, with $31.3 million in remaining amortisation, to the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) to support modernised digital trade tools and
services and integrate artificial intelligence into internal processes. This
includes moving away from paper-based systems and expanding the use of
digitalised import and export certificates to simplify processes, reduce the
risk of errors, fraud, and delays, and enhance traceability. Export certificates
would also be standardised to help exporters adhere to other countries’
requirements and reduce the burden of attesting to product safety. These
investments will support faster, simpler, and more reliable services from the
CFIA—crucial for Canadian exporters.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $32.8 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $9.6 million ongoing to the CFIA to secure, expand, and
restore market access for Canadian agriculture and agri-food, fish, and
seafood sectors. This includes engaging directly with other countries to
strike new trade agreements and expand existing ones, identify and address
trade barriers, enhance regulatory cooperation, and advocate for greater
market access.

SHIFTING FROM RELIANCE TO RESILIENCE 147
As a prominent exporter of grain, Canada is reliant on a robust and well-
coordinated supply chain to facilitate the efficient movement of grain across the
country and to international markets. The government acknowledges the
interdependence within Canada’s grain supply chain and is committed to
ensuring interests are appropriately balanced and that the system enables
business investment and confidence in our capacity to meet the transportation
needs of the sector.
• 	The government will continue ongoing work to assess the challenges
facing different stakeholders within the supply chain and how changes in
one area may impact others. This work includes longstanding issues, such
as transportation forecasting and planning, and infrastructure capacity.
Gender and Diversity Impacts Spotlight
Budget 2025 takes action to support Canadian businesses by:
• 	Prioritising inclusion in federal procurement through a new Buy Canadian
Policy. This will include a Small and Medium Business Procurement
Program to help lower barriers for these enterprises accessing federal
procurement opportunities.
Budget 2025 also works to ensure the benefits of growth are widely shared by
removing barriers that limit participation and access for underrepresented
groups by:
• 	Enhancing Canada’s Trade Access Through Digital Modernisation to help
agriculture, agri-food, fish and seafood producers, harvesters, and
processors export more efficiently. Recognising digital divides, firms with
limited internet, populations with lower digital literacy, and persons with
disabilities may face barriers. To mitigate these barriers, the program will
include real-time user feedback to address accessibility.
• 	Amendments to AgriStability. In the immediate term this program will
support livestock agricultural producers with pasture-related feed charges
but will also take steps to identify barriers for underrepresented groups
who may face challenges in accessing financing, by starting voluntary
collection of disaggregated data in fall 2025.
For more information on the expected impacts of Budget 2025 measures on
these and other diverse groups of Canadians, please see Annex 6.

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 153
A core mission of Canada’s new government is to empower Canadians by
building Canada’s economic strength. From the beginning of our mandate,
Canada’s new government has been relentlessly focused on bringing down costs
for Canadians. On its first day, we cancelled the divisive consumer carbon price
—bringing down gasoline prices by approximately 18 cents per litre in most
provinces and territories as of April 2025.
The government is also delivering on a tax cut for 22 million middle-class
Canadians—saving a two-income family up to $840 per year. The government is
reducing taxes to lower the cost of homeownership for first-time home buyers—
saving Canadians up to $50,000 when they purchase a home for themselves and
their families. The government cut tolls for all vehicles on the Confederation
Bridge from over $50 to $20, and fares by 50 per cent on ferries in Atlantic
Canada and to Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine—leading to a 25 per cent increase in
usage for traffic leaving Prince Edward Island in August compared to the
previous year.
By lowering costs for Canadians, the government is creating an economy where
every Canadian has more control over building their own future. Canadians will
strengthen our shared sense of identity, history, and geography by protecting
our culture, nature, official languages, and core values—and we will continue to
build the country and its economy in close partnership with Indigenous Peoples.
-- 163 of 493 --

154 CHAPTER THREE
3.1 Supercharging Home Building
Across the Country
Canada continues to face a steep
housing supply gap. The Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(CMHC) estimates that to restore
housing affordability to 2019 levels,
homebuilding must nearly double to
between 430,000 and 480,000 units
per year over the next decade, while
the Parliamentary Budget Officer
(PBO) estimates 290,000 units
annually would be needed to close
the housing supply gap (Chart 3.1).
The core challenge in the housing
market is the difficulty in building
housing stock. Loans are expensive,
builders face multi-year delays in
permitting, and land, development charges, and taxes can make up close to half
of project costs. High construction costs are exacerbated by little productivity
growth in construction in the past 25 years (Chart 3.2). To turn this around, the
Government of Canada will catalyse a more productive homebuilding industry
with fewer barriers and less red tape so that builders can build homes at the
scale we need.

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 155
Launching Build Canada Homes
On September 14, 2025, the government launched Build Canada Homes—a new
federal agency that will build affordable housing at scale. BCH’s mission is to
build and finance more affordable homes, while catalysing a new housing
industry.
BCH will help tackle homelessness by expanding transitional and supportive
housing in partnership with provinces, territories, municipalities, and Indigenous
communities. It will also build deeply affordable community and co-op housing
for low-income households, while working with private and non-profit builders
to increase the supply of affordable homes for the Canadian middle class.
Build Canada Homes will transform how the public and private sectors work
together, deploying modern construction methods, and catalysing an entirely
new Canadian housing industry. It will leverage public lands, offer flexible
financial incentives, attract private capital, facilitate large portfolio projects, and
support manufacturers to deliver housing at scale.
Canada’s new government will bring federal lands, faster approvals, and strong
incentives to the table. The private sector will bring construction capacity,
innovation, supply chains, and financing.
Build Canada Homes will focus primarily on non-market housing, supporting a
mix of income needs as part of a national effort to double housing construction,
restore affordability, and reduce homelessness.
There are three key pillars to this new approach:
1. Build Canada Homes will partner with industry, other orders of
government, and Indigenous communities to build affordable housing,
including co-op housing, at scale and at speed.
2. Build Canada Homes will deploy capital, secure demand, and harness
innovative housing technologies to build faster and more sustainably, 365
days a year.
3. Build Canada Homes will adopt the government’s new Buy Canadian policy
and prioritise projects that use Canadian lumber and other Canadian
materials.
-- 165 of 493 --

156 CHAPTER THREE
With an initial investment of $13 billion over five years on a cash basis, starting
in 2025-26, Build Canada Homes will deploy capital to supercharge the housing
industry. Build Canada Homes has a mandate to move quickly and this fall, the
government announced its first four investments and initiatives:
1. Developing public land sites and prioritising innovative, factory-built
housing, starting with six sites to build 4,000 factory-built homes with
additional capacity of up to 45,000 units across Canada Lands Company’s
portfolio.
2. Protecting existing affordable housing by launching the $1.5 billion Canada
Rental Protection Fund under Build Canada Homes.
3. Providing $1 billion to build transitional and supportive housing for people
who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
4. Partnering with the Nunavut Housing Corporation to build over 700 public,
affordable, and supportive housing units.
Developing Arbo Downsview
On October 17, 2025, Build Canada Homes launched a Request for
Qualifications to engage builders for the development of 540 new homes at
Arbo Downsview in Toronto. This represents Build Canada Homes’ first
housing development project. At least 40 per cent of the units on the site
will be affordable, with a mix of studios, one-, two-, and three-bedroom
homes, supporting middle-class families.
Build Canada Homes will identify Design-Build teams with proven
expertise in factory-built housing and other modern methods of
construction—including prefabrication, modular building, and mass timber—
to ensure speed, affordability, and quality.
This development is also being enabled by the up to $283 million federal
investment through the Canada Housing Infrastructure Fund to upgrade
the nearby Black Creek sewer system.

Building a new generation of co‑op housing
The federal government has a strong role to play in building non-market
housing and Build Canada Homes is central to that role. Ensuring more
affordable housing options for Canadians includes building co-operative
housing. For decades, co-ops have provided Canadians with secure,
affordable, and community-oriented homes.
The Co-op Housing Development Program was co-designed with the Co-
operative Housing Federation of Canada and the co-operative housing
sector and is the largest investment supporting the co-op housing sector in
the last 30 years. The program is estimated to support the development of
thousands of affordable rental co-operative housing units by 2028.
Earlier this year, the program allocated $423 million in funding in support of
eight new co-op buildings, creating a total of 837 new homes with more to
come.
Eliminating the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for First-
Time Home Buyers
To immediately bring down costs for many Canadians, Canada’s new
government is eliminating the Goods and Services Tax (GST) for first-time home
buyers on new homes up to $1 million and reducing the GST for first-time home
buyers on new homes between $1 million and $1.5 million.
The removal of the GST for first-time home buyers, which is currently before
Parliament as part of Bill C-4, helps bring down the costs of a newly built
home—immediately making the goal of home ownership a reality for more
Canadians, especially young families.
Training the Next Generation of Canadian Builders
Building major infrastructure and millions of more homes will create high-paying
careers for Canadians. These careers will require training for workers, so the
newest generation of Canadian builders can build Canada Strong. The
government will continue to prioritise building together, and ensuring Canadians
can see the community benefits of building our infrastructure and housing,
including through supporting union labour.

158 CHAPTER THREE
As announced on October 27, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to provide
$75 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Employment and Social
Development Canada to expand the Union Training and Innovation
Program, which supports union-based apprenticeship training in the Red
Seals trades.
Building More Multi-Unit Homes
Multi-unit homes are critical to increasing the housing supply and providing
affordable housing to Canadians. To catalyse the creation of these types of homes,
the government is supporting the financing of new multi-unit rental housing
through mortgage loan insurance and securitisation.
Budget 2025 announces that the government will increase the Canada
Mortgage Bond (CMB) annual issuance limit from $60 billion to $80 billion,
starting in 2026 to unlock thousands of new housing units per year. This will
increase access to cost-effective mortgage funding for lenders, helping them
offer more mortgages and support the construction of new multi-unit
housing across Canada. The increase will apply exclusively to multi-unit
housing. The government will maintain the current pace of its purchases of
CMBs, up to $30 billion annually, to allow the private market full access to
the additional issuance.
Strengthening First Nations Infrastructure Financing and
Access to Clean Water
Our approach to supercharge building will help address infrastructure gaps in
First Nations communities. With engagement with First Nations partners, the
government is continuing to explore new financing tools to make existing
funding more effective and expand the options available to communities to
deliver critical infrastructure.
• 	For example, it is the government’s intention to explore the creation of a
bonding and surety backstop pilot project for First Nations contractors on
reserve to enable on-reserve construction companies to bid for
infrastructure projects, as well as a standalone pilot scheme to monetise
federal transfers to support financing for First Nations infrastructure
on reserve.
The government is committed to ending all long-term drinking water advisories
on reserve and ensuring reliable access to clean drinking water for First
Nations. Since 2015, 149 long-term drinking water advisories have been lifted,
-- 168 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 159
and more than 300 short-term advisories have been prevented from becoming
long-term.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $2.3 billion over three years, starting in
2026-27, to renew the First Nations Water and Wastewater Enhanced
Program. This funding will maintain progress on approximately 800 active
projects, including those focused on ending remaining water advisories and
preventing new ones by upgrading at-risk systems.
Supporting Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure
Access to affordable housing and dependable infrastructure is critical to ensuring
a better future for Indigenous Peoples. This government will take action to
address the unique and persistent housing and infrastructure challenges facing
Indigenous communities.
Build Canada Homes will work with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis leadership to
determine how this mission-driven organisation and the catalysation of this new
modern housing industry can best contribute to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis
identified needs and priorities.
We recognise that the need for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis housing is acute.
For this reason, $2.8 billion is being confirmed for urban, rural, and northern
Indigenous housing. We will work with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis partners to
ensure rapid and effective delivery.
Together with funding that is already working to support housing for First
Nations on reserve, Inuit, and Métis communities, there remains over $3 billion
available for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis to advance their housing priorities.
The Minister of Indigenous Services will coordinate a cross-government
Indigenous Housing Strategy following engagement with First Nations on
reserve, Inuit Treaty Organisations, Métis governments, and Modern Treaty
holders and Self-Governing Indigenous Governments.
The government is also increasing the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s target
for investments in Indigenous infrastructure that benefit First Nations, Inuit,
and Métis communities from at least $1 billion to at least $3 billion across its
priority sectors.

160 CHAPTER THREE
3.2 Tackling Affordability
Canada’s new government has been relentlessly focused on bringing costs down
for Canadians. Above all, the government will empower Canadians by helping
them get ahead and reduce their cost of living.
When Canadians keep more of the money they earn, they can better support
their families, invest in their communities, and build the future they want.
Budget 2025 builds on the actions Canada’s new government has already taken
to make life more affordable—delivering three major tax cuts, supercharging
homebuilding to increase supply and lower housing costs, and introducing
Automatic Federal Benefits so that millions of Canadians receive the support
they qualify for.
Middle-Class Tax Cut
Since July 1, 2025, Canadians have been paying less tax after the government
announced lowering the first marginal personal income tax rate from 15 per
cent to 14 per cent. The rate reduction, which is currently before Parliament as
part of Bill C-4, applies to taxable income of up to $57,375 in 2025, providing
meaningful relief to middle-class Canadians—during a period of significant
economic uncertainty and affordability challenges.
Nearly 22 million Canadians will benefit from tax relief of up to $420 per
person, saving two-income families up to $840 a year. The majority of tax relief
will go to Canadians with incomes in the two lowest tax brackets. Nearly 45 per
cent of the tax relief will go to Canadians with income below approximately
$57,400 (the first tax bracket) and 40 per cent to Canadians with income
approximately between $57,400 and $114,800 (the second tax bracket).

This measure is expected to provide $27.2 billion in tax relief to Canadians over
five years starting in 2025-26.
Cancelling the Divisive Consumer Carbon Price
Canada’s new government cancelled the divisive consumer fuel charge—directly
allowing Canadians to save money from the price they pay at the pump. The
government also removed the requirement for provinces and territories to have
a consumer-facing carbon price as of April 1, 2025. These actions have reduced
gasoline prices in most provinces and territories by up to 18¢/L in comparison
to 2024-2025, lowering headline inflation.
The government is also winding down mechanisms to return direct fuel charge
proceeds to Canadians, small- and medium-sized businesses, farmers, and
Indigenous governments.
This measure is estimated to cost about $4.2 billion in 2025-26. This included a
final Canada Carbon Rebate payment in April 2025 to residents of provinces
where the fuel charge applied.
Eliminating the fuel charge, which is currently before Parliament as part of
Bill C-4, will give Canadian consumers and businesses certainty that the
consumer carbon price is being permanently removed from legislation.

162 CHAPTER THREE
Delivering Automatic Federal Benefits for Low-Income
Individuals
Millions of lower-income Canadians do not file their taxes, either because they do
not have the resources to do so or because they think their income is too low to
owe taxes. This means that people who most need benefits often do not receive
them, causing some Canadians to miss out on the GST/HST Credit, the Canada
Child Benefit, the Canada Workers Benefit, and more benefits they are entitled to.
As announced on October 10 th
, through Budget 2025, Canada’s new
government will start Automatic Federal Benefits for the 2026 tax year that will
reach up to 5.5 million low-income Canadians by the 2028 tax year. These
individuals will be able to review and confirm a pre-filled income tax return, and
the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will automatically file these individuals’ taxes
to ensure they receive government benefits they qualify for—including benefits
that these Canadians may not be aware they are entitled to.
For many Canadians, filing an income tax return is the gateway to accessing
important benefits, such as the Canada Child Benefit and the GST/HST Credit.
While this will make filing easier for millions of lower-income Canadians, some will
not be able to or will choose not to use this new service.
To help individuals with lower incomes receive the benefits to which they
are entitled, Budget 2025 also proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to
allow the CRA to file a tax return on behalf of certain eligible individuals with
lower incomes in simple tax situations who do not owe tax and do not file
themselves. The government plans to consult with Canadians on the
proposed amendments, using this feedback to improve and scale up this
service. This will include consultation with Indigenous partners.
Budget 2025 further proposes to provide $71 million over five years,
starting in 2025-26, with $10.4 million in remaining amortisation and
$8.3 million ongoing, to the CRA to implement these new services.
Making the National School Food Program Permanent
Every child deserves to have the food they need to get a fair start in life,
regardless of their family’s circumstances. Launched in 2024-25 with an
investment of $1 billion over five years, the National School Food Program aims
to provide meals to 400,000 more kids every year, beyond those served by
-- 172 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 163
existing school food programs. The program is saving participating families with
two children an average of $800 per year on groceries.
The National School Food Program is helping provinces, territories, and
Indigenous partners expand their existing school food programs to make sure
more children across the country can enjoy the healthy meals they need. The
Program is good for parents and kids, and it is good for the economy as well. It is
helping take pressure off of families and directly supporting the success of our
kids, while improving children's health, education, and well-being.
As announced on October 10, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to introduce
legislation and provide $216.6 million per year, starting in 2029-30, to
Employment and Social Development Canada, Indigenous Services Canada,
and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, to make the
National School Food Program permanent.
Lowering Costs and Protecting Consumers
Canada’s new government is stepping up to give back control and help Canadians
keep more of their money in their pockets. This includes taking on consumer pain
points and unnecessary costs that can add up at the end of the month.
Budget 2025 announces the government will review fees charged by banks
and other federally regulated financial institutions including Interac e-
Transfer fees and ATM fees. We will use every tool and agency at our
disposal to address any unjustified fees and pain points for Canadians. We
will provide an update on this work in 2026.
Increasing Access to Funds Deposited by Cheque
Digitalisation in the financial sector has brought many benefits for consumers,
but there are risks that consumers who remain reliant on legacy financial
products and services, including cheques, may be left behind. Access to cheque
fund rules are now over a decade old and have not kept pace with cost-of-living
increases or technological advances.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Bank Act to raise the first amount of
immediately available deposited cheque funds from $100 to $150 and to
remove the timing distinction between funds deposited in person and via
other means, as well as introduce regulations to apply the change to trust
and loan companies.
-- 173 of 493 --

164 CHAPTER THREE
Budget 2025 also announces the government’s intention to make
regulations in the coming months to reduce the number of days banks may
hold deposited cheque funds before releasing them to their customers. In
addition, the regulations will raise the current value threshold of $1,500—
below which shorter cheque hold periods apply—which will increase the
number of cheques eligible for earlier access to funds and benefit consumers
reliant on cheque payments.
Protecting Against Economic Abuse
Canada’s financial sector has a critical role to play in detecting signs of abuse
early and providing safe pathways for victims and survivors—many of which are
women, ensuring that everyone can build safe and independent futures.
Budget 2025 proposes to introduce a voluntary Code of Conduct for the
Prevention of Economic Abuse for federally regulated banks. This code, to
be overseen by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, will set clear
expectations for how banks can identify, prevent, and respond to economic
abuse to better protect Canadians.
Economic abuse—such as restricting access to money, sabotaging
employment, or forcing debt—is a common form of gender-based
violence. It can also affect seniors, who can be vulnerable to financial
manipulation or coercion by those they often know and trust. It robs
people of their independence and limits their ability to build secure and
fulfilling lives.
Preventing economic abuse also means ensuring that financial
information and supports are accessible. The development of a voluntary
Code of Conduct for the Prevention of Economic Abuse will be guided by
several principles: taking an inclusive and victim and survivor-centered
approach, promoting financial empowerment and independence,
fostering a collaborative approach among stakeholders, and continuous
improvement.
Protecting Workers Against Wage Theft
Wage theft occurs when an employer fails to pay compensation rightfully owed
to an employee, and represents one of the most common labour standards
contraventions in federally regulated sectors.
-- 174 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 165
To crack down on employers that do not pay workers the wages they have
earned, the 2024 Fall Economic Statement announced the government’s intent to
make regulatory changes to substantially increase the penalties imposed on
federally regulated employers who commit wage theft.
The government remains committed to ensuring workers are protected and
compensated for the work they perform. The work to increase penalties is
currently underway and consultations with workers and employers on proposed
changes will take place over the coming months.
Protecting Workers Against Improper Classification
The deliberate misclassification of employees as independent contractors means
that employers are not withholding and remitting the proper amounts of income
tax, or Canada Pension Plan and employment insurance contributions.
Misclassified employees may lose out on labour law protections, as well as
benefits and pensions available to employees. This misclassification of
employees has been particularly common in the trucking industry.
To crack down on employers that misclassify employees, Budget 2025
proposes to provide $77 million over four years starting in 2026-27, with
ongoing funding of $19.2 million annually, for the Canada Revenue Agency
(CRA) to implement a program that addresses non-compliance related to
personal services businesses, as well as lift the moratorium on reporting fees
for services in the trucking industry.
Budget 2025 also proposes to amend the Income Tax Act and the Excise Tax
Act to allow the CRA to share information with the Department of
Employment and Social Development Canada for the purpose of addressing
worker misclassification.
These measures will strengthen compliance in the trucking industry by ensuring
that employers comply with reporting requirements and tax obligations, while
also protecting workers' rights.
Delivering for Personal Support Workers
Personal support workers support Canadians in living and aging with dignity and
helped us get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding of $1.7 billion over five
years was previously announced as part of the February 2023 Working Together
to Improve Health Care for Canadians plan to increase wages for personal support
-- 175 of 493 --

166 CHAPTER THREE
workers. Bilateral agreements were signed with British Columbia ($232 million),
Newfoundland and Labrador ($25 million), and the Northwest Territories
($5.3 million).
As announced on October 27, Budget 2025 proposes to introduce a
temporary Personal Support Workers Tax Credit, under which eligible
personal support workers employed in the remaining provinces and
territories could claim a refundable tax credit equal to 5 per cent of their
eligible earnings, providing support of up to $1,100 per year.
This measure to support front-line health care workers would be available for
the 2026 to 2030 taxation years and is estimated to cost $1.48 billion over six
years, starting in 2025-26. Of this amount, $1.17 billion would be sourced from
the funding previously committed but unutilised to support wage increases for
personal support workers. This tax credit empowers the personal support
workers that care for us by putting more of their hard-earned money back
in their pockets.
Helping Youth Find and Keep Jobs
Canada’s economic future depends on youth. Investing in their skills and
experience today will create a stronger, more competitive workforce and drive
long-term prosperity. Canadian youth are facing challenges in the labour market,
with the youth unemployment rate sitting at 14.7 per cent in September 2025.
Canada’s new government is committed to supporting youth in building skills to
help them gain employment in high-paying careers.
Canada Summer Jobs, the horizontal Youth Employment and Skills Strategy,
and the Student Work Placement Program empower young Canadians to
develop work-ready skills through hands-on experience and training. These
programs put youth on a path to meaningful, well-paying careers.
To invest in a robust and adaptable workforce, the government is making
investments to support about 175,000 youth in 2026-27, empowering the next
generation with the confidence and skills they need to succeed.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $594.7 million over two years, starting in
2026-27, to Employment and Social Development Canada for Canada
Summer Jobs to support around 100,000 summer jobs in summer 2026.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $307.9 million over two years, starting in
2026-27, for the horizontal Youth Employment and Skills Strategy to
-- 176 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 167
provide employment, training, and wraparound supports (e.g., mentorship,
transportation, mental health counselling) to around 20,000 youth facing
employment barriers annually. $20.1 million of this is offset by funding
already provisioned in the fiscal framework.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $635.2 million over three years, starting in
2026-27, to Employment and Social Development Canada for the Student
Work Placement Program to support around 55,000 work-integrated
learning opportunities for post-secondary students in 2026-27.
Advancing the Youth Climate Corps
Investing in paid green skills training and job placements positions Canada to be
competitive by equipping the workforce needed to build a climate competitive
economy.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $40 million over two years, starting in
2026-27, to Employment and Social Development Canada, to create a Youth
Climate Corps to provide paid skills training for young Canadians. They will
be trained to quickly respond to climate emergencies, support recovery, and
strengthen resilience in communities across the country. The skills training
and work experience opportunities created through a Youth Climate Corps
support reducing youth unemployment, increasing innovation, and
strengthening adaptation and mitigation projects.
3.3 Protecting Canadian Culture,
Values, and Identity
Canada’s values are rooted in our shared identity, cultural richness, and deep
connection to the land. We have so much to be proud of, celebrate, and defend as
Canadians. The government is committed to protecting what makes Canada
unique and brings Canadians together—through continued investments in our
official languages, our public institutions, and our natural and cultural heritage.

Funding for the Department for Women
and Gender Equality
Since its establishment in 2018, the Department for Women and Gender
Equality (WAGE) has empowered women and 2SLGBTQI+ people through
programs that enhance meaningful participation in our economy. WAGE’s
work extends across government, helping departments and agencies include
more Canadians in shaping and strengthening our country’s social and
economic fabric.
Building on the significant progress made by Status of Women Canada to
advance gender equality from 1976 to 2018, WAGE made historic investments
that reduced discrimination and helped women advance in the workplace,
worked with partners to launch federal strategies to address critical issues
impacting women, girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people, and advocated for a future
where everyone can achieve their full potential. However, incidents of gender-
based violence—including femicides—continue, as does hate and violence
targeting 2SLGBTQI+ communities in Canada. The work of WAGE is needed to
eliminate discrimination and advance the rights of women and 2SLGBTQI+
communities.
As announced on October 29, 2025, to ensure WAGE is able to conduct its
critical work and provide long-term benefits, Budget 2025 proposes to
provide WAGE with new funding:
◦ 	$382.5 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, with
$76.5 million ongoing, to revitalise and stabilise efforts to advance
women’s equality in Canada.
◦ 	$54.6 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, with
$10.9 million ongoing, to support the 2SLGBTQI+
community sector. This includes $7.5 million over five years, with
$1.5 million ongoing, for Pride Security.
◦ 	$223.4 million over five years, starting in 2026-27, with
$44.7 million ongoing, to strengthen federal action on gender-
based violence.
-- 179 of 493 --

170 CHAPTER THREE
This new funding will support women’s organisations in addressing deeply
rooted barriers to women’s economic prosperity and success, support the vision
of a Canada free of gender-based violence from coast-to-coast-to-coast, and
advance 2SLGBTQI+ equality, including keeping 2SLGBTQI+ communities and
their allies safe.
Ministers Champagne and Valdez also reaffirmed the government’s commitment
to continue the important ongoing work with the provinces and territories to
end gender-based violence—including through the current bilateral agreements
that enable these jurisdictions to fund essential prevention services and direct
support for survivors.
Empowering Seniors in Their Communities
Far too many of our seniors face isolation in their retirement years, and some
experience ageism, poor health, reduced mobility, poverty, and even
abuse. Canada’s new government is helping to address this by empowering
seniors to thrive in their communities through the New Horizons for
Seniors Program.
The New Horizons for Seniors Program, with a current annual budget of $70
million, supports projects that improve the quality of life for seniors and
promotes their full participation in Canadian society. The program offers up to
$25,000 to support projects in local communities—such as new fitness
equipment for seniors’ centres—and up to $5 million to support projects that are
national in scope and that can benefit seniors across the country, like financial
literacy classes.
Connecting Canadians Through Cultural Experiences and
Community Celebrations
Culture is experienced locally, in our towns, neighbourhoods, and public
spaces. These investments will help bring Canadians together at festivals,
national moments of celebration, and community-driven cultural events
across the country. Budget 2025 proposes to provide targeted support to
strengthen participation, community identity, and cultural access for
Canadians in every region, including:
$21 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for
the Building Communities through Arts and Heritage Program to support
-- 180 of 493 --

local festivals, community anniversaries, and community-initiated
capital projects;
$46.5 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for
the Canada Arts Presentation Fund to support professionally presented arts
festivals or performing arts series;
$20 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for
the Celebration and Commemoration Program to support Canada Day
celebrations;
$4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for the
Celebration and Commemoration Program to support National Acadian
Day; and
$9 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Environment and Climate
Change Canada to support the Biosphère in Montréal.
Investing in Canadian Creators and the
Cultural Economy
Canada’s artists, creators, and cultural entrepreneurs are at the heart of our
creative economy. Their work drives innovation, supports good jobs, and
ensures Canadian stories and voices are heard at home and around the world.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide funding to grow Canada’s creative industries
and help Canadian talent succeed in an increasingly digital and global
marketplace, including:
$48 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for
the Canada Music Fund to enhance the careers of Canadian artists while
strengthening the competitiveness and stability of the Canadian
music sector;
$6 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage
to support the purchase of Canadian content for the
TV5MONDEplus platform;
$150 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Telefilm Canada to
support Canada’s vibrant film industry;
$127.5 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage
for the Canada Media Fund to support Canada’s audio-visual content
creators;
$26.1 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to the National Film

$38.4 million over three years, starting in 2026-27, to Canadian Heritage for
the Special Measures for Journalism component of the Canada Periodical
Fund to help small and community news outlets continue producing quality
Canadian editorial and journalistic content; and
$6 million over three years, starting in 2026-27 for the Canada Council for
the Arts to support professional artists and arts organisations.
Protecting Artists’ and Creators’ Copyrights
Artists, particularly visual artists, are great contributors to Canada’s cultural
scene and among the lowest income earners in Canada despite their significant
cultural contributions. An Artist’s Resale Right provides the creators of original
visual artwork with a royalty whenever their work is resold through an eligible
sale, providing an additional income stream.
In Budget 2025, the government announces its intent to amend the
Copyright Act to create an Artist’s Resale Right in Canada, ensuring Canadian
visual artists benefit from future sales of their work.
Protecting Our National Broadcaster: CBC/Radio-Canada
CBC/Radio-Canada is part of our Canadian identity. Canada’s new government
is protecting our national broadcaster by ensuring it has the resources needed
to modernise and better deliver for Canadians, and to continue providing vital
programming in both French and English.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $150 million in 2025-26 for CBC/Radio-
Canada to strengthen its mandate to serve the public and to better reflect
the needs of Canadians. The government will explore modernising
CBC/Radio-Canada’s mandate to strengthen independence, and is working
with CBC/Radio Canada to explore participation in Eurovision.
Renewing the Canada Strong Pass
This summer, the government introduced the Canada Strong Pass, which helped
Canadians see more of our great country, for less money. The pass provided
families and young people free or discounted access to national parks, museums,
galleries, and rail travel. It brought Canadians together, supported tourism, and
celebrated the values that unite us.
-- 182 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 173
The pass boosted VIA Rail ridership by 6.5 per cent, visits to Parks Canada
places increased by 10 per cent, and visitors at our museums were up around
15 per cent on average.
As announced on October 10, Budget 2025 proposes to provide
$116.3 million over two years, starting in 2025-26, to renew the Canada
Strong Pass for the holiday season, from December 12, 2025 to January 15,
2026, and then again for summer 2026. Reduced-cost access over this
holiday season is already in place through several Canada Strong Pass
partners, including for eligible VIA Rail travel.
Supporting the Royal Canadian Geographical Society
Strengthening Canadian identity and sovereignty begins with equipping
Canadians and young people to understand their land, history, and place in the
world. For nearly a century, the Royal Canadian Geographical Society has
advanced this mission—reaching over 4.3 million monthly readers of Canadian
Geographic and 28,000 educators and 750,000 students each year through its
award-winning education programs.
To promote knowledge of Canada and national unity, Budget 2025 proposes
to provide $4 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, and $1 million
ongoing to the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. This funding is to be
sourced from existing Canadian Heritage resources.
Improving Access to Health Care in the Arctic and
the North
Canadians deserve timely access to health services whenever and wherever
they are needed. And yet health care delivery in Canada’s Arctic and North is
hampered by insufficient infrastructure, a shortage of health care workers, and
limited access to hospitals outside of major population centres. Many people
must leave their communities to access specialised care or to give birth. These
inequities are particularly persistent for Indigenous communities. As a result,
territorial governments face high costs to provide necessary care for their
residents.
To improve health care access and services, Budget 2025 announces the
government’s intention for the Minister of Health and the Minister of
National Defence, in collaboration with the Minister of Indigenous Services
and the Minister of Northern Affairs and Arctic Affairs, to undertake a
-- 183 of 493 --

174 CHAPTER THREE
comprehensive assessment of health care and health infrastructure needs in
the North, with the goal of identifying innovative ways to increase access to
health care in northern communities and reduce medical travel costs through
engagement with Northen and Arctic Indigenous Peoples.
In short order, the Special Representative will release their external review of
Nutrition North Canada. The government will take this review seriously and
remains committed to co-developing with Inuit and Northern Indigenous leaders,
evidence-based food security approaches that better meet the high cost of living
and affordability challenges faced by many Inuit and Northerners.
Empowering Canadian Fishers and Building
Coastal Communities
Small craft harbours are essential to the way of life of coastal communities,
supporting work and recreation for nearly 45,000 Canadians. The government’s
Small Craft Harbours program supports the operations and maintenance of a
national system of close to 950 harbours, representing over 10,000 structures
valued at approximately $7.1 billion. Of these 950 harbours, roughly 690 are
considered critical to the commercial fishing industry. The government ensures
these harbours are fully operated, in good working condition, and managed and
maintained by self-sufficient harbour authorities who represent the interests of
users and communities.
The government is committed to continued support for the Small Craft
Harbours program. Recently provided support includes:
• 	$463.3 million over three years on a cash basis, starting in 2024-25,
announced in Budget 2024 for repairs and maintenance of small craft
harbours across the country. This funding is in addition to the program’s
$90 million annual budget.
• 	$70 million over two years, starting in 2022-23, to support the repairs of
small craft harbours damaged by Hurricane Fiona in 2022 as part of the
Hurricane Fiona Recovery Fund.
Lowering Barriers to Access the Canada
Disability Benefit
Since issuing the first payments in July 2025, the Canada Disability Benefit has
increased the financial well-being of hundreds of thousands of working-age low-
income persons with disabilities. However, for many, obtaining a valid Disability
-- 184 of 493 --

EMPOWERING CANADIANS 175
Tax Credit certificate to become eligible for the benefit can represent a
financial barrier.
Budget 2025 reaffirms the government’s intention to lower barriers to
access the Canada Disability Benefit by helping to offset the costs of
applying for the Disability Tax Credit for Canada Disability Benefit
recipients. To that end, Budget 2025 proposes funding of $115.7 million
over four years, beginning in 2026-27, and $10.1 million per year ongoing,
including administrative costs, for a one-time supplemental Canada
Disability Benefit payment of $150 in respect of each Disability Tax Credit
certification, or re-certification, giving rise to a Canada Disability Benefit
entitlement. This one-time payment would be retroactive to the launch of
the Canada Disability Benefit. Following successful completion of the
regulatory process, the first supplemental payments are expected to be
made to Canada Disability Benefit recipients before the end of 2026-27.
In addition, the government is committed to looking at ways to provide such
a payment in respect of other Disability Tax Credit certifications as part of
its work to review and reform the process to apply for the credit.
Helping to reduce poverty and increase the financial well-being of low-income
persons with disabilities is a key priority in the government’s work to build a
fairer Canada.
To help ensure Canada Disability Benefit recipients keep the full value of
their benefits, including other federal income-tested benefits and programs,
such as the Canada Child Benefit, Budget 2025 confirms the government’s
intention to bring forward legislation to exempt the Canada Disability
Benefit from being treated as income under the Income Tax Act.
Gender and Diversity Impacts Spotlight
Budget 2025 takes action to improve outcomes for women by:
• 	Proposing stable, long-term funding for the Department for Women and
Gender Equality, which will continue to support progress in eliminating
discrimination and advancing the rights of women.
• 	Increasing affordable and non-market housing through Build Canada Homes.
According to the 2021 Census, single-parent households are still
predominantly women (81.2 per cent), and will particularly benefit from more
affordable housing.
-- 185 of 493 --

176 CHAPTER THREE
• 	Strengthening First Nations Infrastructure Financing and Access to Clean
Water. Women, in First Nations communities, would disproportionately
benefit. Women in these communities are more likely to shoulder caregiver
responsibilities.
• 	Proposing to introduce a voluntary Code of Conduct for the Prevention of
Economic Abuse for federally regulated banks, as women are
disproportionately affected by economic abuse, which is a common yet
under-recognised form of gender-based violence.
Budget 2025 will support First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities by:
• 	Strengthening Indigenous Infrastructure and Access to Clean Water, by
working to ensure First Nations communities have reliable access to clean,
safe drinking water, and providing supports for First Nations and Inuit
communities to renovate and build affordable housing. Since November 2015,
First Nations have lifted 149 long-term advisories, with 38 still active in 36
communities.
• 	Supporting Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure, which will work with
Indigenous communities to address their unique and persistent infrastructure
needs through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
• 	Addressing Economic Abuse, as Indigenous communities are among the
groups most affected by financial abuse, with Indigenous women more likely
to experience financial abuse by an intimate partner compared to non-
Indigenous women.
Budget 2025 will support the financial well-being of young people by:
• 	Helping Youth Find and Keep Jobs. Providing employment services, training,
and wrap-around supports will benefit youth facing barriers, especially those
without a high school diploma, who are Indigenous, newcomers, racialised,
have disabilities, and live in rural areas.
For more information on the expected impacts of Budget 2025 measures on
these and other diverse groups of Canadians, please see Annex 6.

PROTECTING CANADA’S
SOVEREIGNTY AND
SECURITY

-- 191 of 493 --


-- 192 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	183
As the world grows more volatile and dangerous, now more than ever, Canada
must be ready and able to defend our territory, our people, and our values to
secure our sovereignty and to protect and uphold our commitments to our
Allies. This includes helping to counter Russian aggression and to uphold
Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity to ensure security across the Euro-
Atlantic region.
In this period of great power competition and geopolitical uncertainty, Canadian
leadership in the world will be defined not just by the strength of our values, but
also by the value of our strength. A more confident, united, and stronger Canada
can help transform this age of disorder into an era of prosperity for all Canadians.
This starts with rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed
Forces. The government’s generational investments in our Canadian Armed
Forces will provide our military with the necessary tools and equipment to
protect our sovereignty and bolster our security. This increase in investment also
creates opportunities for the Canadian defence industry. We will reform defence
procurement to make it easier and faster to buy Canadian-made equipment—
supporting our domestic defence industry and creating high-paying careers.
The Canadian Armed Forces are currently active in 37 operations around the
world. The women and men of our military contribute to promoting global
peace and security, while ensuring Canada’s place in the world. Canadian
military operations range from maintaining international security and stability in
the Middle East (Operation AMARNA), to leading a Multinational Brigade as
part of NATO’s assurance and deterrence measures in Central and Eastern
Europe and the Baltics (Operation REASSURANCE), to whole-of-government
sovereignty patrols and security exercises in Canada’s Arctic (Operation
NANOOK).
To address years of inadequate equipment for the Canadian Armed Forces and
to strengthen Canada’s defence industry, Canada’s new government is
accelerating investments to meet the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s
(NATO) 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) target this year and put
Canada on a pathway to meet the NATO Defence Investment Pledge of
investing 5 per cent of GDP in defence by 2035.
As part of this pledge, Canada will invest 3.5 per cent of GDP by 2035 in core
military needs such as supporting the Canadian Armed Forces, modernising our
military equipment and technology, and building up our defence industries. An
-- 193 of 493 --

184 CHAPTER FOUR
additional 1.5 per cent of GDP will also be dedicated to defence and security-
related investments made by all levels of Canadian government, such as
telecommunications and emergency preparedness systems which serve national
defence and national security purposes. The government expects that currently
planned spending by federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments
will meet this 1.5 per cent commitment.
Through these investments, we are giving our Canadian Armed Forces the tools
they need to defend every square foot of our sovereign territory, from the
seafloor to the Arctic to cities to cyberspace, and to protect Canadians from
present and emerging threats.
To protect our communities, Canada’s new government is also cracking down on
illegal drugs and gun trafficking, hiring 1,000 new Royal Canadian Mounted
Police (RCMP) personnel and 1,000 new Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
officers, and making bail and sentencing laws stricter. In September, the
government introduced new legislation to address the horrifying rise in hate,
especially in Antisemitism and Islamophobia, and to protect religious and cultural
buildings and spaces. Our government is fighting hate so that together, we can
build a country where Canadians of all faiths can live their lives openly, freely,
and safely. This is Canada, and in Canada, you should be able to wake up, get in
your car, drive to work, or your place of worship, come home, and sleep soundly
at night. Canada’s government is committed to making that promise a reality.
4.1 Defending Our Sovereignty
Canada must be prepared to defend our people, to secure our sovereignty, and
to protect our Allies. Budget 2025 lays out the government’s plan to secure
Canada, fulfill our responsibility to shared security with our Allies, build a world-
class defence industrial base, and establish a new Defence Investment Agency
that will accelerate the procurement process.
Rebuilding, Rearming, and Reinvesting in the
Canadian Armed Forces
Canadians are proud of our Armed Forces and their unwavering dedication to
protect us and our sovereignty. They keep people and communities safe
through major disasters. They protect our sovereignty and respond to threats in
our Arctic. They contribute to NATO’s deterrence and collective security efforts
-- 194 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	185
around the world. Our Canadian Armed Forces are among the best in the world,
and they deserve the capabilities necessary to succeed in an increasingly
challenging threat environment.
In 2013, Canada’s defence spending fell to less than 1 per cent of our GDP.
It has since more than doubled in absolute terms, but more is needed. The brave
members of our Canadian Armed Forces who are protecting our sovereignty do
not have all the resources they need for a riskier world. Our military
infrastructure and equipment need to be upgraded and updated, our defence
capabilities need to be rebuilt and reasserted, and we need to work with
partners to further research, investment, and procurement.
Canada’s new government is providing our military with the tools it needs to
meet the modern threat environment by rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in
the Canadian Armed Forces.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $81.8 billion over five years on a cash
basis, starting in 2025-26, to rebuild, rearm, and reinvest in the Canadian
Armed Forces (CAF). This includes over $9 billion in 2025-26 that was
announced by the Prime Minister in June 2025. Key investments include:
◦ 	$20.4 billion over five years, to recruit and retain a strong fighting
force, including generational pay raises for the CAF, and support
CAF health care.
◦ 	$19.0 billion over five years to repair and sustain CAF capabilities
and invest in defence infrastructure, including expanding
ammunition and training infrastructure.
◦ 	$10.9 billion over five years for upgrades to Department of
National Defence, CAF, and Communications Security
Establishment digital infrastructure, including those needed for
modern warfare, such as cyber defence.
◦ 	$17.9 billion over five years to expand Canada’s military
capabilities, including investments in additional logistics utility, light
utility, and armoured vehicles, counter-drone and long-range
precision strike capabilities, and domestic ammunition production,
among other investments.
-- 195 of 493 --

186 CHAPTER FOUR
◦ 	$6.6 billion over five years, starting in 2025-26, to strengthen
Canada’s defence industry through a Defence Industrial Strategy.
As the Strategy is implemented, starting with initial investments
announced in Budget 2025, we will develop our defence industrial
base so that more of our military capabilities are procured from
Canadian supply chains. (See below for additional details).
◦ 	$6.2 billion over five years to expand Canada’s defence
partnerships, including expanded military assistance to Ukraine and
increased military training and international policy programming.
◦ 	$805 million over five years to the Canadian Coast Guard, the
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and Public Services and
Procurement Canada for complementary initiatives to support
Canada’s defence capabilities.
Launching the Defence Industrial Strategy
Canada’s new government is moving to take immediate and decisive action to
rebuild Canada’s defence capacity, rearm the Canadian Armed Forces, and
invest in the Canadian defence industry. This generational investment in our
defence and security creates enormous opportunities for Canadian businesses.
-- 196 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	187
The defence sector in Canada accounts for over 81,200 direct and indirect jobs.
Past defence projects have generated high-paying jobs in local communities.
The opening of the new B Jetty in CFB Esquimalt in British Columbia created
close to 1,300 jobs during its construction. The Future Aircrew Training
program, an $11.2 billion investment in training the next generation of Canadian
aviators, has the potential to create or maintain 3,400 jobs annually across
Canada. Our River-class Destroyer project is expected to create or maintain
over 5,000 jobs over the next 15 years, many of which will be in Halifax,
Nova Scotia.
As we invest to build Canada’s defence industrial base, our renewed commitment
to defence will create many more fulfilling, high-paying careers for Canadian
workers. Business opportunities will be across the supply chain: from the
production of raw materials, including steel and aluminum, to the truckers and rail
workers who ensure their transit, to those who transform these materials into
equipment, weapons, ammunition, and vehicles. It will also drive innovation in
technology sectors, including artificial intelligence, quantum, and cyber.
To that end, the government is launching a new Defence Industrial Strategy.
This strategy will ensure Canada’s defence investments are now guided by a
whole-of-government approach to building sovereign defence capacity—
creating high-paying careers, opportunities for businesses, and sourcing
Canadian resources in the process.
Initial Investments Under the Defence Industrial Strategy:
Of the $6.6 billion to strengthen Canada’s defence industry noted above, the
government is already allocating $4.6 billion over five years on a cash basis,
starting in 2025-26, for initial investments under the forthcoming Defence
Industrial Strategy to improve access to capital, drive research and innovation,
bolster domestic supply chains, and grow critical resource stockpiles. The
government will release the Defence Industrial Strategy in the coming months.
Key initial investments include:
• 	$68.2 million over three years, starting in 2025-26, to the Department of
National Defence (DND), Innovation, Science and Economic Development
Canada (ISED), the National Research Council (NRC), and the
Communications Security Establishment to establish the Bureau of
Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science
(BOREALIS).
-- 197 of 493 --

188 CHAPTER FOUR
• 	$1.0 billion in 2025-26 to create a new Defence and Security Business
Mobilization Program at the Business Development Bank of Canada
to provide loans, venture capital, and advisory services to help small-and
medium-sized businesses contribute to Canada’s defence and
security capabilities.
• 	$656.9 million over five years, starting 2025-26, to ISED to develop and
commercialise dual civilian-military technologies in a range of industries,
including aerospace, automotive, marine, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence,
biodefence, and life sciences.
• 	$334.3 million over five years, starting in 2025-26, to ISED, NRC and
the National Science and Engineering Research Council for a suite of
measures to help anchor quantum technology companies in Canada and
provide pathways to technology adoption in defence-related
applications and industries.
• 	$443.0 million over five years, starting in 2025-26, to Natural Resources
Canada and ISED to support the development of innovative critical minerals
processing technologies, support joint investments with Allies in Canadian
critical minerals projects, and develop a critical minerals stockpiling
mechanism to strengthen Canadian and Allied national security.
• 	$182.6 million over three years, starting 2025-26, to DND to establish a
sovereign space launch capability.
A New Defence Investment Agency
Canada’s new government is focused on providing the women and men in uniform
with the equipment they need, when they need it. With the right tools in their
arsenal, we will reinforce Canada’s sovereignty, create high-paying new careers for
Canadian workers, and strengthen our defence partnerships with Allies.
Canada’s defence procurement is currently fragmented across several departments,
slow to consult industry, and too complicated to respond to rapidly evolving military
needs—leading to significant delays in delivering critical equipment. To protect our
sovereignty and bolster our industrial capacity, the government announced the
creation of a new Defence Investment Agency (DIA), which will overhaul and
streamline Canada’s defence procurement. The DIA will approve procurements to
support strategic defence sectors in Canada, so that we are able to ensure the
Canadian Armed Forces has the world-class equipment it needs, and at the same
time create new careers, grow our economy, and support innovation in aerospace,
shipbuilding, and advanced manufacturing.
-- 198 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	189
The Defence Investment Agency will have three objectives:
1. Consolidate procurement processes—removing duplicative approvals and
red tape, accelerating defence procurement, and providing industry with
greater clarity and certainty. With a centralised process of review and
approval, procurements will advance faster.
2. Target procurements to support strategic defence sectors in Canada, so
that we are able to meet the capability needs of the Canadian Armed
Forces, and at the same time create new careers, grow our economy, and
supercharge innovation in aerospace, shipbuilding, and advanced
manufacturing.
3. Ensure earlier engagement between the Canadian Armed Forces and
Canada’s defence industry, so the military can communicate operational
needs, and industry can provide realistic assessments of timelines, costs, and
technological options. Early engagement will ensure both the government
and industry can better anticipate future needs and build industrial capacity
ahead of time, at speed and scale.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $30.8 million over four years, starting
in 2026-27, with $7.7 million ongoing to Public Services and Procurement
Canada to establish the DIA. The DIA will accelerate the delivery of goods
and services to better meet the needs of the CAF at the best value for
Canadians by centralising processes and enhancing engagement and
collaboration with Canadian industry and international partners. The
Agency’s focus will be on defence procurements valued at $100 million
and above, including submarines and other critical capabilities that the
CAF requires.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $52.5 million over five years, starting
in 2026-27, with $12.2 million ongoing to Public Services and
Procurement Canada to modernise and increase capacity for the
Industrial Security Program to meet the needs of the DIA and support
Canada’s defence industry.
-- 199 of 493 --

190 CHAPTER FOUR
Strengthening Canada’s Presence: Operations
REASSURANCE and AMARNA
Canada launched Operation REASSURANCE in 2014 following Russia’s first
invasion of Ukraine. More than a decade later, it remains the CAF’s largest
overseas mission, with approximately 2,000 troops currently deployed to deter
Russian aggression and defend NATO territory.
Canada is strengthening transatlantic security and reaffirming our commitment
to defend NATO territory in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. Under
Operation REASSURANCE, Canada provides Armed Forces personnel to the
Canadian-led NATO Multinational Brigade-Latvia (MNB-Latvia).
In MNB-Latvia, Canada leads around 3,000 troops from 14 contributing nations.
The work of the Canadian Armed Forces strengthens NATO’s defence of its
Eastern Flank and contributes to deterrence efforts along Latvia’s nearly
300 km border with Russia.
In August 2025, the Prime Minister announced the renewal of Operation
REASSURANCE for three years, starting in 2026-27. This renewal will sustain
the Brigade’s personnel and military capabilities in Latvia—reinforcing our
collective defence, strengthening co-operative security, and keeping NATO’s
presence strong on its Eastern Flank.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $2.7 billion over three years on a cash
basis, starting in 2026-27, to the Department of National Defence in
support of the renewal of Operation REASSURANCE. Operation
REASSURANCE will remain the CAF’s largest overseas mission.
This year, Canada also launched Operation AMARNA, the CAF’s contribution to
strengthening peace and security in the Middle East. Operation AMARNA
allows the CAF to adapt to changing geopolitical dynamics and respond to
emerging security challenges in the region.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $300.1 million over three years on a
cash basis, starting in 2025-26, to the Department of National Defence
and the Communications Security Establishment to support Operation
AMARNA. This will be partly offset by $155.8 million over three years of
existing Department of National Defence resources.

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	191
4.2 Protecting Our Borders
and Communities
In a time of global uncertainty,
Canada’s new government is
taking action to ensure it can
adapt and respond to emerging
threats to protect the safety
and security of our
communities. Cross-border
smuggling of illegal guns and
drugs, including fentanyl and its
precursor chemicals, and other
security threats put Canadian
communities at risk. Canada’s
response to these threats,
including to organised crime
groups and the illicit financing
networks that underpin their
criminal activity, is robust
and dynamic.
Investing Where It Counts: Defence Investments
to Drive Economic Growth
Defence spending is about more than just security—it also has the potential to
catalyse economic growth and innovation and strengthen long-term prosperity
for Canadians in the defence sector and beyond. This is because defence
spending entails investments in strategic assets—including dual-use
infrastructure, advanced technologies, and sovereign capabilities—that durably
boost the economy’s productive capacity.
The initial research and development (R&D) initiatives outlined above—
amounting to $2.3 billion over five years to support R&D in quantum
computing, space, aerospace, and other advanced technologies—could add as
much as $6.1 billion to Canada’s national income over the long term. This is on
top of the benefit of defence investments in enhancing Canada’s national
security and resilience.

192 CHAPTER FOUR
Canada’s new government is hiring more new law enforcement personnel,
investing in enhanced investigative capacity, and is removing dangerous assault-
style firearms from Canadian communities. The government is choosing to build
stronger communities—where you feel secure in your home, safe in your
neighbourhood, and in control of your future.
Strengthening Federal Law Enforcement
Tougher laws are only one part of safer communities—we also need the people
and the resources to enforce them. Canada’s new government is investing in
hiring more RCMP personnel to enforce our laws and protect our communities.
This means we are increasing federal policing capacity across Canada to combat
crime—including online fraud, money laundering, online child sexual
exploitation, and organised criminal networks that threaten Canada’s economic
and national security.
As announced on October 16, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to provide
$1.7 billion over four years, starting in 2026-27, with $591.9 million in
2030-31, $227.1 million in remaining amortisation, and $500.3 million
ongoing for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to strengthen the
organisation’s response to a wide range of threats related to transnational
organised crime, financial crimes and money laundering, while enhancing
its intelligence and national security capacity. This would fulfill the
government's commitment to hire 1,000 RCMP personnel.
As announced on October 16, 2025, Budget 2025 also proposes to provide
$90.1 million over four years, starting in 2026-27, and $22 million ongoing
to the RCMP to increase the cadet recruitment allowance to $1,000 per
week. This will be partly offset by $20 million over four years, $9.8 million in
2030-31 and $9.4 million ongoing in expected revenue from contract
policing partners. This will better attract and maintain qualified and diverse
RCMP candidates.
Establishing a Financial Crimes Agency
Criminals continue to exploit Canada’s economy and financial system to commit
sophisticated financial crimes, such as financial fraud, and to launder their illicit
proceeds. To combat these serious crimes and protect Canadians, Canada must
take bold action, modeled after international best practices.
-- 202 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	193
As announced on October 20, 2025, Budget 2025 will leverage
investments in federal law enforcement capacity outlined above, to
establish a new Financial Crimes Agency to be Canada’s lead
enforcement agency against financial crimes. This agency will be a best-
in-class model that aims to unite the police and civilian expertise needed
to investigate complex cases of money laundering, organised criminal
activity, and online financial scams, and to recover illicit proceeds.
The Minister of Finance and National Revenue will work with the
Ministers of Justice and Public Safety to introduce legislation to stand up
this agency by Spring of 2026.
Enhancing the Canada Border Services Agency
As announced on October 17, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to provide
$617.7 million over five years, starting in 2025-26, with $51.3 million in
remaining amortisation and $198.3 million ongoing for the Canada Border
Services Agency (CBSA) to increase its capacity to detect and intercept
illicit goods, and defend Canadian industries by enforcing import measures
and bolstering its trade remedy capacity. Budget 2025 will also increase
the CBSA’s recruit stipend from $125 to $525 per week.
As also announced on October 17, 2025, Budget 2025 proposes to
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act to extend the operational
service early retirement program to frontline CBSA officers and other
eligible frontline employee groups in the Public Service Pension Plan, so
that they receive pension benefits that reflect the weight of their
responsibilities, at a cost of $216.8 million over five years, starting in
2025-26, and $10.8 million ongoing.
This funding is complementary to the $1.3 billion Border Plan announced in
December 2024, which together will allow the CBSA to hire up to 1,000
new officers.
Canada Community Security Program
To address the horrifying rise in hate, and hate-related crimes in our
communities, including numerous incidents of Antisemitism and Islamophobia,
Canada’s new government introduced the Combatting Hate Act, to better
protect access to places of worship, schools, and community centres, and to
more clearly address and denounce hate-motivated crimes.
-- 203 of 493 --

194 CHAPTER FOUR
Budget 2025 announces that the Minister of Public Safety will engage
with the impacted communities to develop a comprehensive and
equitable approach, including through reforms to the Canada Community
Security Program, to ensure Canadians are no longer afraid because of
who they are, how they worship, or where they gather. More details to
be announced in due course.
Modernising the Meteorological Service of Canada
For over 150 years, the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) has provided
Canadians with up-to-date information about the weather. The MSC’s High-
Performance Computing (HPC) solution is the only system in Canada capable of
running the models required to produce weather forecasts, alerts, warnings, and
climate projections. This essential federal service supports Canadians and key
sectors of the economy (e.g., agriculture, transport, and marine shipping) in
making informed decisions that protect people, property, and foster economic
growth, and provide timely information to emergency responders and the CAF.
Canada’s new government is investing in a modernised computing system for
the MSC to ensure Canadians have access to more reliable weather forecasts.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $2.7 billion over nine years, starting in
2025-26, with $57.4 million in remaining amortisation, to replace the
MSC's High-Performance Computing solution, put in place back-up
systems in a separate location, and modernise the HPC operations.
Renewing Canada’s National Public Alerting System
The National Public Alerting System saves lives. It warns of natural disasters,
giving Canadians time to flee the area, and it reports on abducted children,
helping to bring them to safety. The government is ensuring Canadians get
these critical, lifesaving alerts by creating a new National Public Alerting
System model. The Mass Casualty Commission recommended transformative
change to better prevent and respond to critical incidents and mass casualty
events in the future and make Canadian communities safer. These actions
respond to the Commission’s recommendations on public alerting.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $55.4 million over four years, starting
in 2026-27 and $13.4 million ongoing to Public Safety Canada to support
a new National Public Alerting System model, ensuring Canadians
continue to receive Amber Alerts and warnings of imminent natural
disasters, extreme weather events and security threats so they can take
action to protect themselves and their communities.
-- 204 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	195
Improving Preclearance at Canada’s Borders
Efficient and effective transportation across airports and marine ports is crucial
to building one Canadian economy and fostering trade. To make air and marine
transport more seamless, the government is investing in improving preclearance
at Canada’s borders.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $14.8 million over four years, starting
in 2026-27, with $1.1 million in 2030-31 and $20.6 million in remaining
amortisation, to Transport Canada to develop and implement a new
preclearance access regime, ensuring a more secure transportation
system for Canadians. Funding will also enable Transport Canada to
invest in digital solutions to maximise efficiency in security screening
activities, supporting timely onboarding of employees in transportation
facilities across Canada. This will complement the opening of the new
preclearance facility at Billy Bishop Airport, for which the government
invested $30 million into in 2023.
Removing Assault-Style Firearms from our Streets
Weapons made for the battlefield do not belong on Canadian streets—where
children walk to school, where workers wait for the bus, and where you live. To
protect our communities, Canada’s new government is removing assault-style
firearms from our streets. These measures respond directly to the Mass
Casualty Commission’s recommendations.
Budget 2025 proposes to realign previously announced funding for a net
fiscal impact of $38.7 million over three years, starting in 2025-26, to allow
for the continuation of the Assault-Style Firearms Compensation Program.
The program will be implemented in the most efficient and cost-effective
way possible, within its existing funding envelope of $742 million.
Strengthening Canada’s Emergency Management
Wildfire seasons in Canada are becoming more severe and are having lasting
impacts on the lives of Canadians. Protecting our communities from these
devastating wildfires requires bold approaches and committed, coordinated
action from all levels of government.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $257.6 million over four years, starting
in 2026-27, to Natural Resources Canada to lease four aircraft to bolster
provincial and territorial aerial firefighting capacity.
-- 205 of 493 --

196 CHAPTER FOUR
4.3 Building a Stronger Financial System
In a world that is changing—with rising geopolitical, security, and natural disaster
risks—protecting our communities also means ensuring Canadians and businesses
have protections for their assets and have a strong and secure financial system.
Combatting Financial Fraud
From ghost texts and mysterious links, to masked voiceover calls and phony bank
emails, financial fraud and crimes are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
harder to detect—and remain an ever-growing threat to the financial well-being of
Canadians everywhere. Seniors, newcomers, and other vulnerable populations are
disproportionately affected. In 2024 alone, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre
reported that Canadians lost $643 million to fraud, representing nearly a 300 per
cent increase since 2020, while only 5 to 10 per cent of scams are reported.
In response, the Government of Canada is taking decisive action to enhance
enforcement measures and ensure Canadians can feel confident that their
financial systems are secure and resilient.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to develop a whole-
of-government National Anti-Fraud Strategy. This strategy will bring
together financial institutions, technology, and telecommunication
companies to develop a cross-sectoral approach to protect Canadians
from evolving and highly complex fraud schemes.
Budget 2025 also announces the government’s intention to amend the
Bank Act and make relevant regulations to:
◦ 	Require banks to have policies and procedures to address consumer-
targeted fraud.
◦ 	Allow consumers to adjust maximum transaction amounts, and
require banks to obtain the express consent of consumers to
enable certain account features and permit consumers to disable
features they do not need, with these features to be prescribed
in regulation.
◦ 	Require banks to report data on consumer-targeted fraud to the
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, with the specific data
points to be prescribed in regulation. Anonymised data would
-- 206 of 493 --

PROTECTING CANADA’S SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY 	197
subsequently be reported to the Minister of Finance to inform the
government’s future policymaking on financial fraud.
Ensuring Crime Doesn’t Pay
The government strongly supports Bill C-12, the Strengthening Canada’s
Immigration System and Borders Act, which includes a comprehensive package of
measures to support Canada’s fight against financial crimes. These measures will
ensure Canada knows the businesses and professionals that work every day to
support Canada’s Anti-Money Laundering/Anti-Terrorist Financing Regime and
will strengthen supervision, compliance, and information sharing under the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA).
Complementing these measures, Budget 2025 confirms the government’s
intention to take steps to further protect Canadians and Canadian business from
financial crimes.
Budget 2025 proposes to protect businesses from being abused by criminals
by amending the PCMLTFA and its regulations to address the most prevalent
forms of cash-based money laundering by restricting: large cash transactions
of $10,000 or more; and the depositing of cash by one person to another
person’s account (i.e., third-party cash deposits).
Canada launched in February a new Integrated Money Laundering Intelligence
Partnership (IMLIP) between law enforcement and Canada’s big banks. This
partnership will bolster Canada’s response to organised crime and high-end
money laundering schemes, including related to fentanyl trafficking.
To support the IMLIP, Budget 2025 proposes amendments to the PCMLTFA
with related amendments to the Personal Information Protection and
Electronic Documents Act to clarify public to private information sharing.
Strengthening the Review of Foreign Bank Investments
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to propose
legislative amendments to the Bank Act to enable the review of certain
types of investments in Canadian businesses by foreign banks and their
affiliates for national security risks. This would ensure consistency with
how other foreign investments in Canada are assessed, including under
the Investment Canada Act, to protect sensitive technology, infrastructure,
-- 207 of 493 --

198 CHAPTER FOUR
or data. The government will launch targeted consultations to inform the
proposed amendments.
Improving Insurance Resiliency Against Natural Disasters
More can also be done to ensure Canadian consumers are protected by a
resilient financial system in the face of extreme events like earthquakes.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to consult federally
regulated property and casualty insurers and other interested
stakeholders on ways to ensure the stability of Canada’s insurance sector
in an extreme earthquake event.
Gender and Diversity Impacts Spotlight
Budget 2025 takes action to protect diverse groups from a broad range of risks
to their safety and well-being by:
• 	Removing Assault Style Firearms from our Streets, which prioritises
groups most affected by gun violence. In 2023, men 18+ were 56 per
cent of victims, women and girls were about one third of victims, and 67
per cent of firearm-related intimate partner violence victims. Indigenous,
Black, and other racialised communities face significant victimisation.
• 	Renewing Canada’s National Public Alerting System will especially help
seniors, persons with disabilities, Indigenous people, and low-income
households by providing accessible, bilingual alerts for wildfires, floods,
public safety threats, and Amber Alerts. In 2024, 879 alerts were issued
nationwide.
• 	Combatting Financial Fraud will protect all Canadians, especially seniors,
who are more often targeted by phone scams, as well as younger people
who face rising risks on digital platforms. In 2024, reported losses totaled
$643 million, and only 5 to 10 per cent of frauds are estimated to be
reported.
For more information on the expected impacts of Budget 2025 measures on
these and other diverse groups of Canadians, please see Annex 6.

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 205
Canada’s new government made a clear commitment to Canadians to bring fiscal
discipline to the federal budget. We will spend less on government operations, so
we can invest more in the workers, business, and nation-building infrastructure
that will build Canada Strong. To achieve this goal, Government itself must
become much more productive by rightsizing, cutting red tape and wasteful
spending, and adopting AI at scale. Canada’s new government will balance
Canada’s operating budget within three years by making responsible, pragmatic
choices—shifting the composition of spending toward capital investments that will
grow the economy and prosperity for Canadians. We will make smart,
generational investments to build the country we want for ourselves.
By spending less to invest more we can empower Canadians with new
opportunities, better careers, and a lower cost of living. We can protect our
sovereignty, our borders, our communities, and our way of life. We can build a
stronger economy and build prosperous communities across the country.
5.1 Spending Less to Invest More
To spend less, we are modernizing government operations to deliver better
results for Canadians and reduce costs. Through an ambitious savings plan, we
are slowing the growth in direct program spending from 8 per cent to under
1 per cent. Budget 2025 introduces new measures to make federal programs
and services more effective and focused.
This includes results from the Comprehensive Expenditure Review—a
government-wide exercise to reduce duplication and inefficiencies and realign
activities towards the core federal mandate. Greater efficiency will allow
resources to be directed towards increasing public service productivity and
improving how services are delivered to Canadians, particularly through the
integration of technology and artificial intelligence (AI).
Comprehensive Expenditure Review
Budget 2025 delivers on the Comprehensive Expenditure Review—reducing
inefficiency and focusing on core priorities.
It will rein in government spending—saving Canada $13 billion annually by
2028-29, for a total with other savings and revenues of $60 billion over five
years.
-- 215 of 493 --

206 CHAPTER FIVE
Over the last decade, from 2015 to 2024, the federal public service grew by
more than 40 per cent—double the rate of economic growth. After direct
program expenses began to fall from their COVID-19 peak in 2020-21, the
federal public service continued to expand. These increases are unsustainable.
This has left federal finances strained, and put the vital services and programs
that Canadians rely on at risk.
Savings will be achieved by restructuring operations and consolidating internal
services and rightsizing programs to realize efficiencies. It will also involve
workforce adjustments and attrition to return the size of the public service to a
more sustainable level. We will also take action to close tax loopholes and make
sure everyone is paying their fair share.
To meet the moment, we must reinvent government to be fit for the 21st
century. This means recalibrating activities and fiscal room towards our core
mandates—spending less on the day-to-day running of government.

From a peak of almost 368,000 in 2023-24, the public service population is
expected to reach roughly 330,000 by the end of 2028-29—a decline of about
40,000 positions or 10 per cent. This reflects normal attrition through
retirements, voluntary departures, and previous savings exercises, as well as
further action the government is taking to slow spending and return the public
service to a sustainable size. Through the Comprehensive Expenditure Review,

and the introduction of new and better tools such as AI, the tech-enabled public
service of the future will still deliver the services that Canadians depend on.
The Comprehensive Expenditure Review will return government spending to
sustainable levels—enabling the government to direct federal spending to
enhance productivity and towards capital formation. Each Minister has been
tasked with reviewing spending within their portfolio to assess which programs:
1. 	are meeting their objectives
2. 	are core to the federal mandate, and
3. 	complement—rather than duplicate—services delivered by other federal
departments or levels of government.
This review is not an across-the-board reduction exercise. It is a measured and
strategic approach to improve public service productivity. To achieve this
objective, federal departments and agencies undertook a thorough review of
their organizations, identifying programs and activities that were
underperforming, duplicative or that had strayed away from the core federal
mandate. Departments were directed to develop proposals using Gender-Based
Analysis Plus to understand how Canadians, including vulnerable groups, would
be affected. Statutory transfers payments to provinces, territories and
individuals were outside the scope of the review. The Department of Finance
and Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat worked with departments to ensure
their proposals were sustainable and did not create program integrity pressures
or impact the health, safety and the national security of Canadians.
Furthermore, the government ensured the proposals did not materially impact
core science, research and Indigenous programming.
Evaluation of the proposals was done thoroughly, with strong governance. The
Cabinet Committee on Government Transformation / Government Efficiency
reviewed all proposals to ensure appropriate oversight and to apply a consistent,
whole-of-government approach. Following Cabinet’s review, the Minister of
Finance and Prime Minister made final decisions for inclusion in Budget 2025.
With this review, the government is making responsible choices to modernise
government, right-size programs, improve efficiencies, and deliver better results
and services for Canadians. By spending less, we can make the generational
investments that grow our economy and protect the essential programs that
keep your costs down.
-- 217 of 493 --

208 CHAPTER FIVE
The Comprehensive Expenditure Review will achieve savings of $9 billion in
2026-27, $10 billion in 2027-28 and $13 billion in 2028-29. Combined with
other savings and revenues in Budget 2025, this will total $60 billion over five
years, starting in 2025-26. Detailed allocations of savings by portfolio are
available in Annex 3.
Planned savings fall under three themes generally: Modernising Government
Operations, Streamlining Program Delivery, and Recalibrating Government
Programs.
• 	Modernising Government Operations: The federal government needs to
change how it operates and how things are being done to address the
challenges we are facing as a country. This theme includes increasing the
efficiency of back-office and administrative functions, leveraging new
technology, and limiting spending on discretionary travel and training, and
the use of external consultants ($25.2 billion over four years).
• 	Streamlining Program Delivery: Identifying the right federal program to help
you, your family or your business can be complicated and confusing. To make
programs more accessible for Canadians and improve administrative
efficiency, several federal organizations will streamline their program delivery
to improve services and reduce duplication ($1.5 billion over four years).
• 	Recalibrating Government Programs: To better align federal funding with
the needs of Canadians and priorities of today and tomorrow, the
government has identified opportunities to refocus several programs. This
will help prioritize programs that will deliver the greatest impact ($17.5
billion over four years).
Consistent with a focus on improving productivity and efficiency, more than half
of the total savings originate from actions to modernize government operations.
This will contribute to reducing projected growth in the government’s day-to-
day operating spending, while maintaining programs and major transfers to
Canadians. The government recalibrated programs through this exercise in order
to deliver on the new generational investments in infrastructure, housing, and
sectoral support provided in Budget 2025.
While this review has involved tough choices, these adjustments make sense to
ensure responsible use of public funds while delivering the support Canadians
expect from their government. Through the review, the focus has been on
linking both spending and savings to key outcomes, a number of which are
presented below.

Prioritizing Programming to Focus on
Housing Supply: The government is moving
towards a new delivery approach to build and
finance more affordable homes, while
recalibrating programming that does not
directly contribute to increasing the housing
supply. To improve results on housing builds,
we are pivoting towards the historic Build
Canada Homes.

Infrastructure funding will be realigned to
better support needs across the country.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s
launch of the new Build Communities Strong
Fund ($51 billion over ten years), which will
provide historic infrastructure funding to
provinces, territories and municipalities, while
relying on their expertise to determine how
funding can best be allocated.
$2.3 billion over four years
Modernizing Supports for Canadian
Industries and Workers: Innovation, Science
and Economic Development Canada’s Net
Zero Accelerator has faced declining demand,
despite targeted calls. To respond to the
significant economic challenges resulting from
U.S. tariffs and other geopolitical
developments, the government is investing in
the Strategic Response Fund to support
Canadian industries and workers. This Fund
will provide timely and robust supports to
those who need it most to help grow our
economy.

Outcomes
Savings
(26-27 to 29-30)
Implementing a Fleet Divestment Strategy:
The government is making generational
investments in our national defence to
protect Canada’s security and sovereignty.
We are ensuring the Canadian Armed Forces
has the equipment it needs. The Department
of National Defence will divest fleets reaching
end of service life, saving costly repairs and
sustainment costs. Divestment will be
coordinated with investments in modernized
replacement capabilities.
$1.1 billion over four years
Refocusing Operations within the
Department of Fisheries and Oceans: The
government is streamlining internal services
and eliminating redundant functions no
longer required following the transfer of the
Canadian Coast Guard to the Department of
National Defence.
$0.5 billion over four years
Wrapping Up the Tree Planting Program: The
government will wind down the 2 Billion
Trees program. Existing contribution
agreements and commitments will be
honoured, and uncommitted funds will be
returned. The government remains committed
to sustainable forest management practices –
to date, the program has committed to
planting nearly 1 billion trees.
This includes a new climate competitiveness
strategy that will drive investment in clean
growth through the Clean Economy
Investment Tax Credits.
$0.2 billion over four years
Streamlining Government Operations: All
government organizations have undertaken a
thorough review to reduce inefficiencies in
daily operations and consolidate back-office
operations. As one example, Public Services
and Procurement Canada has identified
savings that will be achieved by reducing
administrative requirements and delayering
management. Like many organizations, it will
transform service delivery, by automating
processes, leveraging technology, and
reducing outdated systems that contribute to
unnecessary costs.

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 211
By 2028-29, reductions from the Comprehensive Expenditure Review will
represent 4.9 per cent of projected direct program expenses. These reductions
are consistent with exercises taken in previous years to ensure that the federal
government’s finances are sustainable. Chart 5.2 illustrates the reductions from
previous review exercises at maturity as a share of projected direct program
expenses.
Chart 5.2 –Reduction as a Share of Projected Direct Program Expenses* at
Maturity – Previous Reviews
Sources: Finance Canada calculations.
Notes:
*Direct program expenses do not include major transfers to individuals or to other levels of government. The
Comprehensive Expenditure Review makes no changes to major transfers to individuals or other levels of government.
1) Budget 1995 did not present total direct program expenses for 1997-98. Reductions are calculated as a percentage of
the 1997-98 direct program expenses projected in Budget 1996. Above figures from Program Review reflect only the
$7.2 billion reduction to direct program expenses by 1997-98. Budget 1995 also announced an additional $4.7 billion in
reductions in 1997-98 impacting major transfers, which are not included in this chart for a consistent comparison with
other reviews.
2) The figure for Refocusing Government Spending reflects the planned reductions published in the 2024-25 Main
Estimates.
3) Direct program expense figures for Refocusing Government Spending and the Comprehensive Expenditure Review
do not include actuarial gains or losses.
Savings across departments and programs vary, reflecting the need to protect
the important mandates that some organizations have in delivering frontline
services, social programs, and priorities such as defence and security.
• 	Recognizing recent investments and the importance of securing Canada’s
sovereignty, security and border, the Department of National Defence, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canada Border Services Agency’s
annual savings target was set at two per cent of the review base. Given
their essential role in keeping our country safe, this approach is also being
taken with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and the
Communications Security Establishment.

212 CHAPTER FIVE
• 	A resilient Canadian economy needs to advance research and attract and
retain the top research talent to supercharge our growth. Recognizing this
priority, the targets of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research
Council, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research are also being set at two per cent,
to protect the councils’ important contributions in improving our global
competitiveness and contributing to the economy of the future.
• 	The Department for Women and Gender Equality (WAGE) empowers
women and 2SLGBTQI+ people through programs to eliminate
discrimination and advance the rights of women and 2SLGBTQI+
communities. To support WAGE in continuing this critical work, its annual
savings target is being set at two per cent of its review base.
• 	The government remains committed to reconciliation. Crown-Indigenous
Relations and Northern Affairs Canada and Indigenous Services Canada
deliver important programs that are legally or constitutionally required,
including child and family services, primary health care, and essential
community infrastructure. The government will review how these
organizations can deliver these programs more efficiently, with a two per
cent savings target.
Actions taken through the Comprehensive Expenditure Review to reduce day-
to-day operating spending complement other fiscal actions in Budget 2025,
including proposing a reverse charge mechanism to help combat carousel fraud
schemes and proposed legislative amendments to reform and modernize
transfer pricing rules, to protect the integrity of Canada’s tax system and ensure
the government collects revenues that it should.
Workforce Renewal
The savings identified through CER will contribute to returning the size of the
public service to a more sustainable level, with an estimated reduction of 16,000
full-time equivalents, or roughly 4.5 per cent of the workforce as of March
2025. Of these reductions, some 650 will be executive positions, representing
about 7 per cent of the executive population. These reductions will continue the
trend towards a more sustainable public service size of roughly 330,000 by
2028-29, a decline of about 40,000 or 10 per cent from the 2023-24 peak—
where attrition has, and will continue to be, a driver. The government
understands that transitions can be difficult and is committed to minimising
-- 222 of 493 --

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 213
hardship for federal employees, while also protecting diversity in the public
service workforce and ensuring a strong, younger generation of public servants.
This is a transformational time for the public service to revisit how we work,
how we can improve services to Canadians and how we can build for the future.
A leaner public service is a more empowered and productive public service.
To manage these reductions to the greatest extent possible through attrition
and voluntary departures, Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Public Service
Superannuation Act and the Income Tax Regulations to offer a voluntary Early
Retirement Incentive (ERI) program through the Public Service Pension Plan.
Public servants at age 50 or above for Group 1 and age 55 or above for
Group 2 who have at least ten years of employment, with at least two years
of pensionable service in the Plan may apply to participate under parameters
set by Treasury Board. These parameters will be designed to maintain
essential services and business continuity. Eligible employees will be able to
retire with an immediate pension based on years of service with no penalty
for early retirement. Implementation would proceed by January 15, 2026, or
when legislation receives Royal Assent, and the government intends to
conclude the ERI process within one year. This program, which will be
sourced from the Public Service Pension Fund, is estimated to have a net
fiscal impact of $1.5 billion over five years, starting in 2025-26, while
providing ongoing savings of $82.0 million annually.
To support the increased workflow at the Government of Canada Pension
Centre from administering this time-limited program, Budget 2025 proposes
to provide Public Services and Procurement Canada with $15.0 million over
two years, starting in 2025-26.
As the size of the public service adjusts, so too, must the leadership. The
government will reduce the executive cadre in the public service by 1,000
positions overall over the next two years, inclusive of positions reduced
through CER and early retirements.
The government will also reduce expenses on management and other
consulting services by 20 per cent in three years’ time – in order to reduce
wasteful spending and empower the public service to take on more
responsibility and accountability.
These actions will ensure that the public service continues to provide effective
services while being representative of the Canadians that it serves and fostering
the next generation of public servants.
-- 223 of 493 --

214 CHAPTER FIVE
In the coming weeks, participating organizations will be communicating these
measures to their employees and collective bargaining agents. The federal
government will continue to identify more efficiencies and potential savings,
which will be communicated in the 2026-27 Main Estimates and Departmental
Plans.
Optimizing Productivity in Government
To ensure high quality service delivery for Canadians, the government must
continually strive to optimize its productivity and transform how it operates.
The government will make sure public servants are equipped with the tools,
technology and training to do their jobs. We will bring focus to our priorities.
We will clarify accountabilities. We will simplify processes and reduce
duplication. This is about doing things faster, simpler and better.
At the same time, as emerging technologies like AI continue to advance, the
government intends to be at the forefront in their adoption and build and rely
on the skills we have in the public service. Budget 2025 announces that going
forward, the government will:
Improve expenditure management by adopting a regular, predictable review
schedule to ensure continuous optimization of resources. Future reviews will
focus on specific horizontal themes, such as consolidating the administration
of programs, fostering AI implementation and scale-up in the public service,
and reviewing business subsidies and skills programming.
To demonstrate the government’s commitment to restraining the growth in
day-to-day operating spending, it is targeting additional savings of $7.75
billion over three years, starting in 2027-28, and $3.25 billion ongoing.
Results will be reported on in Budget 2026.
Adopting AI to Enhance Productivity and
Improve Services
Budget 2025 announces that the government intends to stand up an Office
of Digital Transformation which will proactively identify, implement, and
scale technology solutions across the federal government—a generational
opportunity for domestic innovators. The Office will identify and eliminate
redundant and counterproductive procurement rules as well as leverage
expertise from internal sources and the private sector to hasten AI adoption.
-- 224 of 493 --

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 215
Budget 2025 also announces that Shared Services Canada, in partnership
with the Department of National Defence and the Communications Security
Establishment, will develop a made-in-Canada AI tool that can be deployed
across the federal government. Shared Services Canada will partner with
leading Canadian AI companies to develop this internal tool. By supporting
innovative research to strengthen public services, this work will protect our
digital sovereignty, keep government data and information safe in Canada,
and create opportunities for the Canadian technology sector.
Leveraging Technology for a More Productive Public Service
Through the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, departments have identified
ways to use technology to achieve savings by streamlining workflows,
reducing manual effort and optimising service delivery.
• 	Shared Services Canada will apply AI and automation across internal
operations, and automate common IT support requests, reducing call
volumes and costs while improving the user experience.
• 	The Department of Justice will integrate AI, advanced analytics and
automation tools to streamline routine tasks, enhance decision-
making and free employees to focus on higher-value strategic work.
• 	Transport Canada will use AI and automation to optimise back-office
activities and reduce costs of dedicated resources assigned to
repetitive tasks, and realign service delivery models with a greater
focus on self-service and technology-enabled solutions.
• 	Public Services and Procurement Canada will implement digital
delivery of procurement-related documents to better manage project
delivery.
Equitable Public Sector Retirement Benefits
In 2019, enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and the Quebec
Pension Plan (QPP) led federal employees and the government to contribute
more than needed to maintain existing pension benefits.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to initiate consultations
with key stakeholders to account for CPP and QPP enhancements and
ensure that federal employees continue to receive the same pension
-- 225 of 493 --

216 CHAPTER FIVE
benefits, without overcontributing. This will save federal employees up to
$1,100 in annual pension contributions, while maintaining their pension
benefit levels. At the same time, this will achieve fiscal savings of $1.1 billion
over four years, starting in 2026-27, and $384 million ongoing from lower
pension expenses for the government.
In 2014, the government increased the number of years of service required to
be eligible for the Public Service Health Care Plan in retirement from two to six,
to ensure that the costs of the Public Service Health Care Plan remained
sustainable and affordable in the future. To ensure benefits remain available to
public servants in retirement, while being reasonable for taxpayers:
Budget 2025 announces that the government will consult stakeholders on
making similar modifications to the Pensioners’ Dental Services Plan so that,
going forward, the years of service required to be eligible to participate in
the Plan in retirement would increase from two to six years. This will not
impact current members. With these changes implemented before the end
of the 2025-26 fiscal year, net savings of $101.8 million over five years,
starting in 2025-26, and $13.1 million per year ongoing are expected.
Collective Bargaining in Good Faith
2025 marks the beginning of a new round of collective bargaining between
federal public service bargaining agents and the government. The government
believes that the best deals are reached by the parties at the bargaining table. In
working to renew collective agreements, the government will negotiate fair and
reasonable agreements that balance the interests of both employees and
taxpayers. At the same time, the government will respect workers’ fundamental
rights to organize, collectively bargain, and commence legal labour actions.
Budget 2025 reaffirms these rights by proposing to introduce amendments
to the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act to ensure the government
can attract and retain the necessary talent for a high-performing public
service to meet the needs of Canadians, while respecting Canada’s fiscal
circumstances relative to its stated budgetary policies and objectives.
Public sector compensation must align with Canadian labour market trends and the
government’s fiscal position, freeing resources to be invested towards growing
Canada’s economy.
-- 226 of 493 --

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 217
Improving the Integrity of Student Financial Assistance
The Canada Student Financial Assistance Program plays an important role in
facilitating access to post-secondary education—providing opportunities for
Canadians to learn new skills and earn new qualifications. Ensuring that it is used
as intended is essential to control costs and to provide a fair chance to students
who rely on this support.
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to propose legislative
and regulatory amendments to address integrity issues related to private
educational institutions by generally limiting access to the Canada Student
Grant for Full-time Students to students attending public educational
institutions and not-for-profit private institutions within Canada.
Internationally, Canada Student Loans and Grants generally would only be
provided to those who attend public institutions. This measure is expected
to result in savings of approximately $1.0 billion over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $280.1 million ongoing.
Addressing integrity issues in the Canada Student Financial Assistance Program
limits the financial risks to the Crown and ensures that post-secondary students
have access to the best educational outcomes.
5.2 Modernising Services
Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern,
agile, and efficient public service—empowered through technology and greater
responsibility. This will create a more effective government, one that is capable
of providing high-quality services for Canadians and businesses as the
economy grows.
Faster Services for Veterans
Canada owes a debt of gratitude to the women and men who answered the call
to serve. Canada’s Veterans should never have to wait unnecessarily for the
services they have earned—they deserve timely, compassionate support. While
recent temporary funding injections have increased processing capacity, which
has enabled reductions to wait times and the backlog, Veterans Affairs Canada
continues to face pressure from rising caseloads. To that end:
-- 227 of 493 --

218 CHAPTER FIVE
Budget 2025 proposes to provide $184.9 million over four years, starting in
2026-27, and $40.1 million ongoing for Veterans Affairs Canada to stabilise
their processing capacity for disability benefits applications and to
modernise operational processes and IT infrastructure for their disability
benefits program.
Maintaining the Effectiveness of Fines and Penalties
The government levies administrative monetary penalties and fines for
violations of certain legislation or regulations. These levies are meant to ensure
everyone follows the rules, whether employment standards, environmental
regulations, or air passenger rights. In the Strong Borders Act and the
Strengthening Canada’s Immigration System and Borders Act, the government
proposed stronger administrative monetary penalties to strengthen compliance
under Canada’s Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Finance Regime.
However, some other fines and penalties have not been reassessed in many
years. To ensure that these remain effective:
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to launch a review of
fines and penalties to ensure the charges are sufficient and that non-
compliance is not just treated as the cost of doing business. Results of the
review will be available in Budget 2026.
Cutting Regulatory and Operational Red Tape
A range of government legislation imposes red tape and regulatory hurdles,
while reducing certainty for businesses and Canadians, and hinders broader
government efficiency and effectiveness. A less visible form of red tape is
legislated requirements that reduce government efficiency and operational
effectiveness. These requirements, such as duplicative reporting or
cumbersome approvals processes, consume a significant amount of public
servants’ time, diverting them from tasks that provide greater value to
Canadians.
In the spirit of the 60-day regulatory review, the government further intends
to introduce a variety of targeted amendments to legislation in order to
increase government efficiency and operational effectiveness. This includes
amendments that would streamline low-risk internal processes, modernise
outdated requirements, eliminate unnecessary and burdensome reporting
requirements, remove unnecessary barriers to agile regulation-making, align
legislative and regulatory authorities across government and provide for the
-- 228 of 493 --

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 219
delegation of certain matters where appropriate. Results of this review will be
available in Budget 2026.
Attracting Private Sector Expertise to the Public Service
There is a need to bring in talent and perspectives from outside the government
into the public service at speed and scale. To this end, the government is
announcing that the Interchange Canada program will be rebranded as the Build
Canada Exchange, with an ambitious, immediate-term goal of integrating
50 external leaders in technology, finance, science, and other sectors into the
public service.
5.3 A More Efficient Tax System
A robust and efficient tax system is what allows the government to support
Canadians, protect the essential services they rely on, and build major
infrastructure and millions of homes. Budget 2025 proposes new measures to
protect the integrity and improve the efficiency of Canada’s tax system.
Protecting the Integrity of the Tax System
Budget 2025 proposes new measures to protect the integrity of Canada’s tax
system, promote a level playing field for taxpayers, and address abusive tax
practices. These tax integrity measures are expected to collectively increase
federal revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars.
To improve tax fairness, Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act
to limit the deferral of refundable tax on investment income through the use
of tiered corporate structures with staggered year ends, for taxation years
that begin on or after Budget Day.
To ensure that Canadian multinational insurers do not avoid tax on their
Canadian insurance business by operating through a foreign subsidiary,
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to clarify that income
derived from assets held by a foreign affiliate of a Canadian insurance
company that support Canadian insurance risks is taxable in Canada.
-- 229 of 493 --

220 CHAPTER FIVE
To protect the integrity of Canada’s tax base, Budget 2025 announces the
government’s intention to propose legislative amendments to reform and
modernise the transfer pricing rules, which are used to determine profit
among the various entities of a multinational enterprise group.
To protect Canada’s revenue base, Budget 2025 proposes a new reverse
charge mechanism to help combat carousel fraud schemes under the Goods
and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax, beginning with the
telecommunications sector.
Improving the Efficiency of the Tax System
Budget 2025 proposes to eliminate or modify tax measures that have proven to
be inefficient, costly to administer, and challenging for Canadian industries at a
time of ongoing global economic uncertainty.
To provide relief to the aviation and boating industries and increase the
overall efficiency of the luxury tax framework, Budget 2025 announces the
government’s intention to end the luxury tax on aircraft and vessels as of the
day after Budget Day.
To simplify Canada’s tax system and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers
and administrative costs for government, and given other efforts such as the
federal foreign buyer ban and municipal and provincial vacant home taxes,
Budget 2025 announces the government’s intention to eliminate the
Underused Housing Tax as of the 2025 calendar year.
5.4 Advancing Indigenous Tax
Jurisdiction Frameworks
In collaboration with proponent Indigenous groups and organisations, the
federal government aims to conclude fuel, alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, and
vaping value-added sales tax arrangements with interested Indigenous
governments. The government will explore other flexible, opt-in approaches for
tax jurisdiction arrangements that continue to advance fiscal relationships and
create more opportunities for Indigenous governments to grow their revenues
and achieve the goals of their communities.
-- 230 of 493 --

CREATING A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT 221
Gender and Diversity Impacts Spotlight
Budget 2025 takes action to support the financial well-being of women by:
• 	Delivering Faster Services for Veterans to support Canadian Armed Force
members and veterans with service-related injuries, illnesses, or disabilitie
Given that women veterans are more likely to experience low income and
larger income declines after release, this group will particularly benefit
from the improved timeliness of services.
For more information on the expected impacts of Budget 2025 measures on
other diverse groups of Canadians, please see Annex 6.

Fiscal Projections
Economic Projections
The average of private sector forecasts has been used as the basis for economic
and fiscal planning since 1994. This helps ensure objectivity and transparency,
and introduces an element of independence into the government’s economic and
fiscal forecast.
The Department of Finance regularly surveys private sector forecasters for their
outlook. Given the speed and scale of recent U.S. trade policy shifts, private
sector forecasts have been revised frequently. The economic forecast reported
here is based on a survey conducted in August 2025. The survey results have
been adjusted to incorporate the actual results of the National Accounts for the
second quarter of 2025 released on August 29, 2025.
The August survey includes the views of 11 private sector economists:
• 	BMO Capital Markets;
• 	CIBC World Markets;
• 	The Conference Board of Canada;
• 	Desjardins;
• 	Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.;

Reflecting the shift in U.S. trade policy toward greater protectionism and the
importance of exports to income generation across Canada the private sector
outlook for real and nominal gross domestic product (GDP) in Canada has been
significantly downgraded since the 2024 Fall Economic Statement (FES 2024)
(Table A1.1). While the full effects will take time to materialise, higher U.S.
tariffs and resulting trade uncertainty are expected to weigh persistently on
Canadian economic performance, putting the economy on a lower trajectory.
In the August survey, private sector forecasters incorporated the tariff measures
and trade policy developments available at the time, and formed their own
assumptions regarding the evolution and potential resolution of trade conflicts.
These assumptions underpin their projections for GDP growth, trade flows, and
the broader macroeconomic outlook. Private sector economists expected
current sectoral tariffs and those applied on non-CUSMA (Canada-United
States-Mexico Agreement) compliant goods to remain in place through the end
of 2025 and most of 2026. While some de-escalation is assumed over time,
forecasters did not anticipate a return to broadly open, low-tariff global trade.
Furthermore, the baseline outlook assumes that trade uncertainty will remain
elevated through 2026, reflecting ongoing tariff threats and a likely complex
review of the CUSMA. This prolonged uncertainty is expected to weigh on
business investment and dampen household confidence. A partial easing of
uncertainty is embedded in the outlook beginning in 2027.
Comparisons of the August survey real GDP growth forecast to those of other
institutions can be found in Table A1.2.
Following growth of 2.0 per cent annualised in the first quarter of 2025, real
GDP contracted by 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, leaving growth at 0.2 per
cent in the first half of the year. Forecasters expect growth to resume but to
remain modest in the second half of the year amid trade uncertainty. Exports
are expected to remain subdued as U.S. tariffs drive demand away from
Canadian steel, aluminum, copper, lumber, and autos. Domestic demand
continues to moderate in the near term as businesses reduce investment in the
face of uncertainty. Households built up precautionary savings due to concerns
about employment prospects. Nonetheless, consumption is expected to be the
main driver of growth over the near term as households are supported by
improved balance sheets and lower interest rates. Real GDP growth is projected
to gradually pick up through 2026, supported by export stabilisation and a
gradual pickup in domestic demand with lower interest rates.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 227
Overall, private sector forecasters expect real GDP growth of 1.1 per cent in
2025 and 1.2 per cent in 2026—down sharply from the FES 2024 outlook of 1.9
per cent and 2.1 per cent, respectively. As the Canadian economy gradually
adjusts to the new trading environment, growth is expected to pick up to about
2 per cent in 2027 and beyond. However, economic activity remains on a
permanently lower trajectory, reflecting the combined effects of ongoing U.S.
tariffs and trade tensions weakening productivity, reduced business investment,
costs from restructuring trade and supply chains, and the resulting drag on
incomes nationwide. Overall, the level of real GDP is about 1.8 per cent lower
than forecast in FES 2024.
The unemployment rate is expected to peak at 7.2 per cent in the fourth quarter,
averaging 7.0 per cent in 2025 (compared to 6.7 per cent expected in FES 2024)
as trade tensions weigh on labour demand. The unemployment rate is expected to
remain elevated and to only gradually decline to reach 6.0 per cent by 2029,
about two years later than projected in FES 2024, pointing to persistent excess
supply.
Private sector economists anticipate that the disinflationary effects of the fuel
charge removal and excess supply will largely offset the direct and indirect cost
pressures from tariffs and supply chain disruptions. As a result, Consumer Price
Index (CPI) inflation is projected to average 2.1 per cent in 2025, slightly above
the 2.0 per cent forecast in FES 2024. Inflation is then expected to return to 2.0
per cent in 2026 and remain at that level over the forecast horizon, in line with
the FES 2024 projection. Since the August survey, Canada has removed most
countermeasures put in place in March 2025 on U.S. imports, with this change
effective September 1, 2025.
The survey was consistent with the Bank of Canada bringing the policy interest
rate to 2.25 per cent by year-end. The Bank of Canada cut the policy rate by 25
basis points on October 29 bringing it to this level. Economists in the survey
expected the policy rate to remain at 2.25 per cent through 2026. Short-term
interest rates are expected to be about 30 basis points lower on average than
forecast in FES 2024, settling around 2.6 per cent by the end of the forecast
period in 2029.
Canadian long-term yields have declined somewhat over the past few months to
stand around 3.1 per cent, reflecting weakening domestic economic data and
renewed expectations of interest rate cuts. Private sector economists expect the
10-year bond rate to increase from an average of 3.3 per cent in 2025 to 3.6 per
-- 237 of 493 --

228 ANNEX 1
cent in 2029 (about 15 basis points higher than in FES 2024). The increase in
long-term yields over the forecast reflects the expectation of larger global
sovereign borrowing needs, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.
At the time of the survey, forecasters expected real GDP growth in the U.S. to
slow to below 1 per cent annualised in the second half of the year reflecting the
introduction of tariffs and increased policy uncertainty. U.S. growth has so far in
2025 remained robust as a surge in AI related investment spending is driving
building activity. Economists expected U.S. growth to average 1.6 per cent in both
2025 and 2026 (previously 1.7 per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively), and to
strengthen to about 2 per cent in the outer years (similar to the FES 2024
outlook).
With global growth prospects being revised down compared to FES 2024 and
growing oil supply from strong production by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), private sector economists expected crude oil prices
to average US$66 per barrel this year and US$65 per barrel in 2026, previously
US$77 and US$76 per barrel respectively. Crude oil prices are expected to
gradually increase thereafter to reach US$71 per barrel by 2029, remaining below
the US$77 per barrel expected in FES 2024.
GDP inflation came in flat in the second quarter of 2025, partly offsetting the
strength of the end of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025. GDP inflation is
expected to average 2.4 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 (compared to
2.0 per cent in both years in the FES). In the outer years, GDP inflation is broadly
similar to the FES outlook.
Reflecting downward revisions to real GDP, the level of nominal GDP is expected
to be lower by $8 billion in 2025 compared to the FES outlook. This downward
revision widens substantially to $45 billion in 2026, reflecting the downgrade to
both real GDP growth and GDP inflation outlook in 2026. Over the forecast
horizon (2025-2029), the level of nominal GDP is lower than the FES 2024
projection by $40 billion on average per year.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 229
Forecasters in the survey saw greater risks to the downside for Canada’s economic
outlook given the potential for additional U.S. sectoral tariffs, the risk that existing
tariffs and spillovers could weigh more heavily on growth than anticipated, and a
substantial repricing in financial markets. Should U.S. tariffs remain in place and
uncertainty lingers, Canadian growth could slow further, delaying the rebound
currently expected for late 2026 and beyond. To support prudent economic and
fiscal planning amidst heightened global and trade uncertainty, the Department of
Finance Canada has developed scenarios to assess the implications of these risks
for the economic and fiscal outlook (see below for details).

Fiscal Projections
The fiscal outlook presented in this budget is based on the economic projections
from the August 2025 survey of private sector forecasters, detailed in the
previous section.
Alignment with Public Accounts
The projections across this annex are consistent with the Government of Canada
accounting principles, aligning with the Public Accounts of Canada and Canadian
public sector accounting standards. In addition, the budget adds an outlook for
capital investments, where presentations are specifically indicated to be in
accordance with the government’s new Capital Budgeting Framework, detailed in
Annex 2.

Changes to Fiscal Projections Since FES 2024
This section presents changes to the fiscal outlook since FES 2024. Table A1.3
provides an overview of all sources of change in the budgetary balance.
Subsequent tables provide details on the outlook for capital investments and the
day-to-day operating balance (Tables A1.4 and A1.5), and economic and fiscal
developments including, for example, year-to-date financial results (Table A1.6).
Overall trade uncertainty and the economy’s slowdown have weakened the
fiscal outlook, particularly through 2026-27 as lower GDP growth and higher
spending associated with relief measures weigh on the budgetary balance.
Against this uncertainty, Budget 2025 invests to build strength at home guided
by fiscal anchors—balance operating spending with revenues by 2028-29 and
maintaining a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio.
Budget 2025 meets both fiscal anchors. As shown in Table A1.3, a deficit of
$78.3 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP, is expected for 2025-26, falling to 1.5 per
cent of GDP by 2029-30. In addition, the federal debt-to-GDP ratio remains
relatively stable across the horizon. This responsible fiscal management will help
preserve Canada’s fiscal advantage.

Outlook for Capital Investments
The government’s fiscal anchors are supported by a new approach to budgeting
that prioritises spending that supports capital formation and crowds in private
sector investment for long-term growth. This new approach is based on the
Capital Budgeting Framework announced on October 6, 2025. This framework
provides a consistent way to classify spending, including tax expenditures, that
contributes to capital formation (called ‘capital investment’) from day-to-day
operating spending. Further details are available in Annex 2.
Table A1.4 below indicates that capital investments will nearly double from
$32.2 billion in 2024-25 to $59.6 billion in 2029-30. Table A1.5 includes
projections for day-to-day operating spending, and demonstrates how this
spending will be balanced with projected revenues from 2028-29 onwards.

234 ANNEX 1
How Trade Actions Impact the Fiscal Outlook
Global trade is being reshaped. For Canada, U.S. trade actions are disrupting
decades of economic integration which introduces risks to Canada’s
economic and fiscal outlook and is contributing towards a deterioration in the
government’s outlook for revenues, expenses, and the budgetary balance.
While it is difficult to isolate the impacts of the U.S. trade actions, the
downward revisions to the economic outlook, primarily from 2026-27
onward, could be expected to result in an average estimated deterioration in
the budgetary balance of $7 billion per year over the forecast horizon relative
to FES 2024.
U.S. trade actions are creating significant uncertainty for businesses. This
dampens the outlook for corporate income tax revenues and net profits from
enterprise Crown corporations. Economic assumptions that underpin the
lower outlook include lower business activity and increased provisions for
credit losses.
U.S. actions have also created heightened volatility. Year-to-date revenues
from customs import duties, for example, have increased substantially due to
the countermeasures imposed in response to U.S. tariffs. These duties are
sensitive to potential trade policy changes, which could introduce additional
volatility in the revenue forecast.
Other revenue streams have been less impacted thus far. Personal income tax
revenue has remained strong despite the trade conflict, and both
employment and average weekly earnings are up relative to the same time
last year. Similarly, other excise taxes have shown limited impact of the trade
disruption as indirect effects on consumption have been moderate to date.
Looking forward, deteriorating economic conditions and heightened
uncertainty are expected to create a drag on the fiscal outlook.
The government is taking steps to diversify trade and to invest in building
Canada strong. These fiscal measures increase spending to support workers
and businesses but also to create opportunities.
Overall, these factors introduce challenges to forecasting as the underlying
assumptions affect the projections over the forecast horizon.

the Pollution Pricing System Since FES 2024”) are netted in row (5), and omitted from the revenue and program
expense subtotals of rows (1) and (2).
Budgetary revenue projections have increased relative to FES 2024 by an
average of $7.5 billion annually from 2025-26 to 2029-30, primarily due to
stronger corporate income tax revenues, reflecting both stronger anticipated
2024-25 results and continuing strength in 2025-26 year-to-date revenues. This
strength has been somewhat offset by lower projected revenue in other
-- 245 of 493 --

236 ANNEX 1
streams, including enterprise Crown corporation revenues and other excise
taxes and duties.
• 	From 2025-26 onward the outlook for income tax revenues has been
revised up, on average, by $8.3 billion annually, largely reflecting higher
corporate income tax revenues. Most of the increase is concentrated in the
first two years of the forecast horizon, in part reflecting higher expected
2024-25 results and strength in early 2025-26 year-to-date results. In
particular, this is driven by higher revenues from the financial sector.
• 	The outlook for excise taxes and duties has been revised down in 2025-26
owing to lower year-to-date Goods and Services Tax revenue. Over the
remainder of the forecast horizon, the outlook is revised down by an
average $0.4 billion per year in line with the projected general slowdown in
nominal GDP.
• 	Revenues generated from Employment Insurance (EI) premiums are
projected to be higher from 2025-26 to 2027-28, driven by growth in
insurable earnings. Lower employment projections reduce anticipated
revenues in the last two years of the forecast.
• 	Other revenues have been revised down in 2025-26 and over the forecast
horizon due to lower expected net profits from enterprise Crown
corporations. This is offset by higher expected interest and penalty revenue,
net foreign exchange revenue and return on investments.
The outlook for program expenses has increased relative to FES 2024 by an average
of $12.6 billion per year from 2025-26 to 2029-30, largely reflecting higher direct
program expenses, primarily from higher projected expenses for contingent
liabilities as well as allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable.
• 	Major transfers to persons are projected to decrease in 2025-26 and 2026-
27 from a reduction in the projected number of beneficiaries receiving
elderly benefits, partially offset by higher Employment Insurance benefits in
2026-27. The remainder of the forecast horizon is broadly aligned with FES
2024 projections.
• 	Major transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities have increased
slightly due to higher projected Territorial Formula Financing based on
higher projected expenditures of provincial and local governments. This is
partly offset by lower projected nominal GDP, which results in downward
revisions to Equalization and Canada Health Transfer payments in the outer
years, and higher projected recoveries with respect to the Quebec
Abatement.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 237
• Direct program expenses are higher primarily from expected growth in
contingent liabilities, principally due to Indigenous-related claims, as well as
allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable.
◦ See an “Update on contingent liabilities”, which shows the growth of
contingent liabilities on the balance sheet, net of settlements. This
increase reflects the government’s efforts to work with Indigenous
partners to address past injustices and accelerate the resolution of
litigation and the implementation of negotiated settlements to support
reconciliation in Canada and is aligned with accounting standards.
Growth in contingent liabilities has an impact on the budgetary balance
in the year the liabilities are recorded. In recent years, this expense has
averaged over $10 billion per year. For prudence, Budget 2025 increases
the projection of expenses for contingent liabilities across the forecast
horizon, with a larger increase for 2025-26 where there is more
information on specific negotiations, cases and claims.
◦ An increase in projected expenses across the horizon has also been made
for the allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable, in line with
the increases seen in 2023-24 and projected in 2024-25, which reflect
the growth of the tax base as well as the aging of the associated
receivable. Under Canadian public sector accounting standards, tax
revenue is recorded as revenue in the year it is earned, while the annual
provision for doubtful accounts, to reflect the best estimate of
uncollectable amounts receivable, is charged to expenses.
• Projected direct program expenses are also higher from provisions for other
obligations such as environmental liabilities and current service costs for
pensions and other employee future benefits; and revised timing and spending
against previously announced measures.
Public debt charges have increased over the forecast horizon primarily due to
increased borrowing requirements and long-term interest rates, offset in part by
lower short-term interest rates.
Net actuarial losses, which represent the amortisation of changes in the value of
the government’s accrued obligations for pensions and other employee future
benefits and pension fund assets, are expected to be lower on average over the
forecast horizon, reflecting updated actuarial assumptions.

238 ANNEX 1
Changes to the Pollution Pricing System Since FES 2024
Effective April 1, 2025, the Government of Canada ceased the application of
the fuel charge in all jurisdictions where it applied, while maintaining its
Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS) for industries in provinces and territories
where it applies. At the same time, the federal government also removed
requirements for provinces and territories to have a consumer-facing carbon
price.
All direct proceeds from the federal system are returned over time in the
province or territory where they were collected. With the cancellation of the
fuel charge effective April 1, 2025, direct fuel charge proceeds return
mechanisms for Canadians, small-and-medium-sized businesses, farmers, and
Indigenous governments are being wound down. Proceeds from the federal
OBPS will continue to be returned either to provincial and territorial
governments or via the OBPS Proceeds Fund.
The net pollution pricing regime line (5) shown in Table A1.6 consolidates the
change since FES 2024 in revenues and expenses from pollution pricing. It
reflects net timing differences from winding down the collection of fuel charge
proceeds and their corresponding return, while maintaining the OBPS and
continuing to honour the return of fuel charge proceeds as specified to small-
and-medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments.
The table at the end of Chapter 3 shows the impact of the policy decision to
end the fuel charge to be a net cost of $4.2 billion in 2025-26. This amount
reflects expenses related to the winding down of the fuel charge system,
including but not limited to the final Canada Carbon Rebate payment in April.
The resulting profiles of proceeds (revenue) and proceeds returned (expenses)
are presented below in the Revenue Outlook and Expense Outlook tables A1.8
and A1.9.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 241
Income Tax Revenues
Personal income tax revenues are projected to increase by 1.5 per cent to
$237.9 billion in 2025-26. Softness in the growth of personal income tax
revenues primarily reflects measures such as the cancellation of the proposed
increase in the capital gains inclusion rate and the reduction of the lowest
personal income tax rate. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth in
personal income tax revenues is projected to average 4.1 per cent per year.
Corporate income tax revenues are forecast to remain flat at $97.1 billion in
2025-26 due to fiscal measures such as the cancellation of the proposed
increase in the capital gains inclusion rate and the extension of the Accelerated
Investment Incentive. Revenue is then expected to decline slightly in 2026-27,
before stabilising throughout 2027-28 and 2028-29. In 2029-30, growth in
corporate income tax revenues is projected to increase to 3.9 per cent,
reflecting a return to the long-term historical trend.
Income taxes paid by non-residents on Canadian-sourced income, notably
dividends and interest payments, are expected to grow marginally by 1.4 per
cent to $13.7 billion in 2025-26, reflecting weakness in year-to-date revenues.
Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth in non-resident income tax
revenues is expected to average 1.7 per cent per year, reflecting a slowdown in
interest payments to non-residents.
Excise Tax and Duty Revenues
Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues are projected to grow 3.6 per cent to
$54.4 billion in 2025-26. Over the remainder of the forecast period, GST
revenues are expected to grow in line with the taxable consumption outlook,
increasing on average by 3.6 per cent per year.
Customs import duties are forecast to substantially increase by 57.8 per cent
to $9.9 billion in 2025-26. This growth primarily reflects higher year-to-date
revenues, driven by the application of countermeasures in response to the U.S.
tariffs. The forecasted revenues from the countermeasures are net of
estimated remissions and other relief (e.g., Duty Deferral Program). The
current projections account for the application of the countermeasures until
the end of 2025-26. Projections will be reviewed, as informed by
developments, prior to the next fiscal year. Customs import duties are
projected to grow in line with the projected growth in imports over the
remainder of the forecast horizon. These duties are sensitive to potential trade
-- 251 of 493 --

242 ANNEX 1
policy changes, which could introduce additional volatility in the revenue
forecast.
Other excise taxes and duties are expected to increase to $13.2 billion in 2025-
26, or by 0.8 per cent, as sluggish growth in motive fuels is expected to be
offset by other components of the excise taxes, particularly Air Travellers
Security Charge. Other excise taxes and duties revenues are projected to grow
to $13.6 billion by 2029-30.
Other taxes include revenues from the two-pillar international tax reform, agreed
to on October 2021 by the members of the OECD/G20. Revenues from these
taxes are projected to be zero in 2025-26 due to the repeal of the Digital
Services Tax and Underused Housing Tax, then grow to $2.1 billion by 2029-30.
This primarily reflects the projected revenues from international tax reform that
would ensure that multinational enterprises are subject to a minimum 15 per
cent tax, no matter where their profits are earned.
Proceeds from the Pollution Pricing Framework
Proceeds from the federal pollution pricing framework are expected to be
adjusted down from $13.6 billion in 2024-25 to $0.0 billion in 2025-26 and
onwards as the fuel charge ceased to apply effective April 1, 2025. Direct fuel
charge proceeds return mechanisms for Canadians, small- and medium-sized
businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments in provinces where the
federal fuel charge applied are being wound down. The residual value indicates
the amounts related to the Output-Based Pricing System.
Employment Insurance Premium Revenues
Employment Insurance (EI) premium revenues are forecasted to grow at
2.1 per cent in 2025-26, supported by strength in the labour force and insurable
earnings. Over the remainder of forecast horizon, EI premium revenues are
projected to grow at an average of 3.4 per cent annually, reflecting steady gains
in insurable earnings. In the long term, strength in the upward trend is partially
offset by lower projected growth of the labour force.
The EI premium rate is projected to be $1.63 per $100 of insurable earnings in
2027. The actual premium rate for 2027 will be set in the fall of 2026,
incorporating the recommendation of the Canada Employment Insurance
Commission based on projections provided by the Office of the Chief Actuary.
-- 252 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 243
Other Revenues
Other revenues consist of three broad components:
• 	Enterprise Crown corporation revenues are projected to increase by
40.3 per cent to $11.3 billion in 2025-26, largely reflecting higher expected
net profits from the Bank of Canada. Over the remainder of the forecast
horizon, growth is projected to average 16.9 per cent annually, driven by net
profits of enterprise Crown corporations as well as interest revenues
generated from the Government of Canada’s purchases of Canada Mortgage
Bonds (CMBs). The government will ensure that the pace and volume of
CMB purchases are aligned with market conditions.
• 	Other program revenues are projected to decrease by 7.4 per cent to $31.8
billion in 2025-26. This is primarily driven by a decrease in interest and
penalty revenue due to lower interest rates, and the waiving of interest and
penalties as part of the tax relief and support provided to businesses in
response to tariffs. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, growth is
projected to average 4.8 per cent annually.
• 	Net foreign exchange revenues and return on investments, which consist
mainly of returns on Canada’s official international reserves held in the
Exchange Fund Account, are volatile and sensitive to fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates and foreign interest rates. Assets in the Exchange Fund
Account are mainly invested in debt securities of sovereigns and their
agencies. They are held to aid in the control and protection of the external
value of the Canadian dollar and to provide a source of liquidity for the
government, if required. Net foreign exchange revenues and return on
investments are projected to decline in 2025-26, largely due to lower short-
term interest rates. Higher returns over the remainder of the forecast
horizon are primarily driven by growth in the level of international reserves
and other loans and investments.

244 ANNEX 1
Revenues from Canada’s Countermeasures
As of October 17, 2025, $6.7 billion in gross revenue has been assessed from
Canada’s countermeasures in response to U.S. tariffs. This includes 25 per cent
tariffs on $30 billion in goods imported from the U.S., 25 per cent tariffs on steel
and aluminum products, and 25 per cent tariffs on vehicles.
A total of $3.0 billion in revenue has been remitted to mitigate the impact of the
countermeasures on the Canadian economy. The net revenue assessed is $3.7
billion and remains subject to revision. As additional claims for remission are
processed, the total amount of relief provided will increase, which will result in
downward revisions to net revenue assessed. The figures in Chart A1.1 below
detail the net revenue assessed as of October 17, 2025. The forecast for net
revenues over the forecast horizon, including adjustments for product scope
changes, anticipated remissions and other relief, is presented in Table A1.18,
titled Policy Actions Since FES 2024.

Net Revenue Assessed from U.S Countermeasures
Note: Totals may not add due to rounding.
Effective September 1, 2025, in recognition of the U.S.’s approach to allow most
Canadian goods to enter the U.S. tariff-free under CUSMA, Canada removed
countermeasures put in place in March 2025 on most U.S. imports. This includes
removing tariffs on $30 billion in goods that had been in place since March 4,
2025 and $14.2 billion in goods that had been in place since March 13, 2025.

transfer of tax points and resulting reduction in federal tax collected for the Youth Allowances Recovery and
Alternative Payments for Standing Programs); statutory subsidies; and payments for the transfer of Hibernia
Net Profits Interest and Incidental Net Profits Interest net revenues to Newfoundland and Labrador.
Major Transfers to Persons
Major transfers to persons are expected to increase from $143.7 billion in 2025-
26 to $170.3 billion in 2029-30:
• 	Elderly benefits are projected to reach $83.1 billion in 2025-26, up 3.5 per
cent. Over the remainder of the forecast horizon, elderly benefits are
forecast to grow by 5.9 per cent on average annually. Growth in elderly
benefits is due to the increasing population of seniors and projected
consumer price inflation, to which benefits are fully indexed.
• 	EI benefits are projected to increase by 22.6 per cent to reach $30.5 billion
in 2025-26, largely reflecting a higher projected unemployment rate in 2026.
EI benefits are expected to grow at an average of 1.7 per cent annually over
the remainder of the forecast horizon.
• 	Canada Child Benefit payments are projected to increase 5.2 per cent to
$30.1 billion in 2025-26, largely reflecting the indexation of benefits to
consumer price inflation. Payments are expected to grow at an average
of 2.7 per cent annually over the remainder of the forecast horizon.
• 	COVID-19 income support for workers were provided during the pandemic
-- 256 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 247
through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, Canada Recovery
Benefits, and the Canada Worker Lockdown Benefit. These temporary
programs are now closed, with projected amounts in 2024-25 mainly
reflecting redeterminations of benefit overpayments.
Major Transfers to Provinces, Territories, and Municipalities
Major transfers to provinces, territories, and municipalities are expected to
increase from $110.8 billion in 2025-26 to $126.3 billion in 2029-30:
• 	The Canada Health Transfer (CHT) is projected to increase from
$54.7 billion in 2025-26 to $65.0 billion in 2029-30, supported by the CHT
growth guarantee of at least 5 per cent for five years (in effect from 2023-
24 to 2027-28), after which it will grow in line with a three-year moving
average of nominal GDP growth, with funding guaranteed to grow by at
least 3 per cent per year.
• 	The Canada Social Transfer will increase from $17.4 billion in 2025-26 to
$19.6 billion in 2029-30, reflecting legislated growth of 3 per cent per year.
• 	Equalization payments are indexed to the three-year average of nominal
GDP growth and are projected to grow 3.7 per cent annually, on average,
from $26.2 billion in 2025-26 to $30.3 billion in 2029-30.
• 	Territorial Formula Financing is projected to grow 5.6 per cent annually, on
average, from 2025-26 to 2029-30 due to growth in provincial/local
expenditures, which are major components of the formula.
• 	Health agreements with provinces and territories are projected to remain at
$4.3 billion in 2025-26 and 2026-27, reflecting $2.5 billion per year for
tailored bilateral agreements, and $1.2 billion per year in transfers
supporting home and community care and mental health and addictions
services that expire after 2026-27. Another $600 million per year in
transfers for long-term care expires after 2027-28.
• 	Canada-wide early learning and child care transfer payments are expected
to increase from $7.9 billion in 2025-26 to $8.5 billion in 2029-30, reflecting
3 per cent per year growth for four years starting in 2027-28 as announced
in 2025. This also includes $625 million over four years, beginning in 2023-
24, for the Early Learning and Child Care Infrastructure Fund.
• 	Canada Community-Building Fund payments, which are indexed at 2 per
cent per year with increases applied in $100 million increments, are
expected to grow from $2.5 billion in 2025-26 to $2.7 billion in 2029-30.
-- 257 of 493 --

248 ANNEX 1
• 	Other fiscal arrangements are projected to reduce transfers by $7.6 billion in
2025-26 increasing to $9.1 billion by 2029-30 due to the Quebec
Abatement. This reflects the value of the historical transfer of tax points to
Quebec in the 1960s and 1970s, which results in a commensurate reduction
in cash transfers to the province.
Pollution Pricing Proceeds Returned to Canadians
The government removed the federal fuel charge effective April 1, 2025; the
federal Output-Based Pricing System remains in place. All direct proceeds from
the federal pollution pricing system are returned over time in the province or
territory where they were collected.
As a result, fuel charge proceeds return mechanisms for Canadians, small- and
medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments in provinces
where the fuel charge applied are being wound down, with proceeds returned
projected to fall from $15.6 billion in 2024-25 to $5.0 billion in 2025-26.
Amounts in 2026-27 and beyond reflect the maintenance of the federal Output-
Based Pricing System only.
Direct Program Expenses
Direct program expenses consist of other transfer payments administered by
departments, and other direct program expenses. Growth in direct program
expenses from 2025-26 to 2029-30 is expected to average below 1 per cent,
compared to 8 per cent in the past decade, taking into account planned
expenditure reduction actions including the Comprehensive Expenditure Review.
Some expenses such as for Indigenous claims and contingent liabilities can impact
either other transfer payments or other direct program expenses.
Other transfer payments administered by departments are projected to increase
from $115.6 billion in 2025-26 to $122.7 billion in 2029-30. Projected growth
reflects much of the programming identified under the capital budgeting
framework in Annex 2, such as support for electric vehicle battery manufacturing,
clean economy investment tax credits, and the Investing in Canada Infrastructure
Program.
Other direct program expenses reflect the cost of doing business for more than
100 government departments, agencies, and Crown corporations, as well as an
allowance for doubtful accounts on taxes receivable. These expenses are
forecasted to decrease from $150.2 billion in 2025-26 to $143.2 billion in 2027-
28, from the phase-in of savings under the Comprehensive Expenditure Review
-- 258 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 249
beginning in 2026-27, as well as from provisioning for contingent liabilities being
higher in 2025-26 than in later years. Gradual growth in later years reflects
investments identified in the capital budgeting framework in Annex 2, including
capital amortisation expense and expenses of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank;
and rebuilding, rearming, and reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces.
Public Debt Charges
Public debt charges are expected to increase from $55.6 billion in 2025-26 to
$76.1 billion in 2029-30 due to projected increases in the stock of debt and
higher interest rates. As a share of GDP, public debt charges are projected to rise
from 1.8 per cent in 2025-26 to 2.1 per cent in 2029-30.
Net Actuarial Losses
Net actuarial losses, which represent changes in the value of the government’s
obligations for pensions and other employee future benefits, are expected to
decline over most years of the forecast horizon, from a projected loss of
$5.0 billion in 2025-26 to a projected net gain of $4.5 billion in 2029-30,
reflecting higher expected interest rates used to measure the present value of
the obligations. The forecast of these net actuarial losses, including gains in the
outer years of the forecast horizon, is volatile and sensitive to projections of
future interest rates. To isolate these measurement impacts from underlying
trends in government spending, expenses in Table A1.9 and the budgetary
balance in Table A1.7 are shown before and after net actuarial losses.
Update on Contingent Liabilities
Consistent with Canadian public sector accounting standards, the
government records a contingent liability when the probability of a future
payment is considered likely and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Provisions for contingent liabilities are continuously reviewed and refined in
light of new information and changing circumstances. Each year previously
recognised contingent liabilities may be reduced or extinguished through
payments, while new obligations or revaluations are recorded to reflect
updated estimates. The resulting balance represents the stock of
outstanding contingent liabilities. Changes in provisions due to revisions in
estimates or the addition of new obligations are reflected in direct program
expenses in the budget.
-- 259 of 493 --

250 ANNEX 1
The majority of the government’s contingent liabilities are associated with
active alternative dispute resolution processes and pending or potential
litigation. As shown in Chart A1.2, total recorded contingent liabilities
increased from $13 billion in 2015-16, to a projected $55 billion in 2024-25,
net of settlements reached. This increase reflects, in part, the government’s
efforts to work with Indigenous partners to address past injustices and
accelerate the resolution of litigation and the implementation of negotiated
settlements to support reconciliation in Canada. Recording a contingent
liability in compliance with accounting standards ensures that the fiscal
framework is provisioned to deliver on this important priority.
Chart A1.2
Annual Stock of Contingent Liabilities from 2015-16 to 2024-25
Source: Government of Canada Public Accounts.
Increases in contingent liabilities in recent years have contributed to growth
in direct program expenses, and variance between projections and year-end
results. There can be considerable uncertainty in forecasting what
contingent liabilities will eventually be recorded under accounting
standards, which are estimates based on the best available information at
the time of closing of the Public Accounts. The amounts recorded reflect
assumptions about the outcomes of negotiations, cases and claims, as well
as methodologies for calculating damages and settlements. Actions are
underway to manage this uncertainty through improved visibility and
oversight on large areas of contingent liabilities, such as Indigenous-related
claims process. In addition, experts are also being engaged on how to
improve public communication of contingent liabilities.

Financial Source/Requirement
The financial source/requirement measures the difference between cash coming
into the government and cash going out. In contrast, the budgetary balance is
presented on a full accrual basis of accounting, meaning that government
revenues and expenses are recorded when they are earned or incurred,
regardless of when the cash is received or paid.
Table A1.10 provides a reconciliation of the two measures, starting with the
budgetary balance. Non-budgetary transactions shown in the table reflect the
reversal of certain revenues and expenses included in the budgetary balance that
have no impact on cash flows in the year, such as the amortisation of non-
financial assets. They also include the addition of changes in asset and liability
balances that have no accrual impact in a year but do result in the inflow or
outflow of cash, such as the payment of accounts payable. An increase in a
liability or decrease in an asset represents a financial source, whereas a decrease
in a liability or increase in an asset represents a financial requirement. The sum of
the budgetary balance and changes in asset and liability balances reflected under
non-budgetary transactions is equal to the government’s net source of (+), or
requirement for (-), cash.

As shown in Table A1.10, a financial requirement is projected in each year over the
forecast horizon, reflecting financial requirements associated with the projected
budgetary deficits, as well as forecast requirements from non-budgetary activities.
A financial source is projected for pensions and other accounts for the earlier years
of the forecast horizon, followed by projected requirements in the later years.
Pensions and other accounts include the activities of the Government of Canada’s
employee pension plans and those of federally appointed judges and Members of
Parliament, as well as a variety of other employee future benefit plans, such as
health care and dental plans, and disability and other benefits for veterans and
others. A financial source for pensions and other accounts reflects the difference
between non-cash pension and benefit expenses recorded as part of the budgetary
balance, such as the amortisation of net actuarial losses and the accrual of future
benefits earned by employees during the year, and actual cash outflows for benefit
payments.
Financial requirements for non-financial assets mainly reflect the difference
between cash outlays for the acquisition of new tangible capital assets and the
amortisation of capital assets included in the budgetary balance. They also include
disposals of tangible capital assets and changes in inventories and prepaid
expenses. Financial requirements are projected in each year over the forecast
horizon, reflecting forecast net growth in non-financial assets.
Loans, investments, and advances include the government’s equity in enterprise
Crown corporations, including Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(CMHC), Export Development Canada, the Business Development Bank of Canada,
and Farm Credit Canada, loans to enterprise Crown corporations to finance their
activities, and the up-to $30 billion in annual purchases of Canada Mortgage Bonds
issued by CMHC. They also include loans, investments, and advances to national
and provincial governments and international organisations, and under government
programs.
In general, loans, investments, and advances are expected to generate additional
revenues for the government in the form of interest or additional net profits of
enterprise Crown corporations, which partly offset debt charges associated with
-- 262 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 253
these borrowing requirements. These revenues are reflected in the budgetary
balance projections.
Other transactions include the payment of tax refunds and other accounts
payable, the collection of taxes and other accounts receivable, the conversion of
other accrual adjustments included in the budgetary balance into cash, as well as
foreign exchange activities and derivatives. Projected net cash requirements for
other transactions over the forecast horizon mainly reflect changes in accounts
payable and accounts receivable and forecast increases in the government’s
official international reserves held in the Exchange Fund Account.
Economic Scenarios Analysis
As a trading nation, Canada depends on exports for roughly one-third of GDP.
Our prosperity is closely tied to global demand. However, large increases in U.S.
tariffs and the resulting trade uncertainty are weakening Canada’s economy.
Tariffs reduce global demand for goods and services, disrupt supply chains, and
constrain the global economy’s productive potential. More directly, tariffs on
Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, softwood lumber, and wood products
are putting Canadian jobs and businesses at risk.
The Canadian economy has already felt the impact. Real GDP rose at an
annualised pace of 0.2 per cent in the first half of 2025. While growth is
projected to pick up in the second half of this year, the pace is expected to
remain modest, according to forecasters in the August private sector survey.
Canada retains strong economic fundamentals and the capacity to rebound
from short-term shocks. Yet the current trade environment imposes persistent
drags on the Canadian economy. Business investment, in particular, is highly
sensitive to clarity about future conditions. Ongoing uncertainty about trade
policy and demand prospects may prompt businesses to continue delaying or
scaling back investment plans.
Lower investment has lasting consequences, reducing Canada’s growth potential
and productivity over the medium term. Consequently, the medium-term
economic performance depends, in no small part, on coordinated action by
Canadian governments and private sector actors to sustain economic demand—
both domestically and abroad.
-- 263 of 493 --

254 ANNEX 1
To facilitate prudent economic and fiscal planning around these risks and to
further stress-test the August private sector survey forecast, the Department of
Finance has developed downside and upside scenarios of Canada’s economic
outlook (Table A1.11).
Downside Scenario
In the August survey, forecasters assumed that trade uncertainty will remain
elevated in the near term but largely dissipates by 2027. In contrast, in the
downside scenario, trade uncertainty persists beyond 2026. This uncertainty
may arise for many reasons. For example, it could stem from escalating
geopolitical tensions and still ambiguous U.S. tariff plans—broad-based, sectoral,
or country-specific—combined with challenges in concluding new agreements.
Beyond directly discouraging business investment—which lowers the economy’s
productive capacity—persistent uncertainty in this scenario also has indirect
effects on the Canadian economy. Uncertain economic conditions lead firms to
maintain precautionary financial buffers, resulting in reduced hiring. Similarly,
cautious consumers delay major purchases to protect their finances and
increase their saving buffers. Against a backdrop of a weakened global economy
and trade environment, Canadian exports face lower demand, while commodity
prices and financial asset values fall. Together, these factors contribute to a
lower level of real GDP compared to the August survey forecast.
Canadian households and businesses must also cope with a tariff environment
not seen in decades. The downside scenario incorporates greater challenges in
adjusting to U.S. tariffs. For example, manufacturers may need to restructure
supply chains, and exporters may need to find new buyers. These shifts come
with adjustment costs, while higher tariffs limit future efficiency gains from
trade and cross-border cooperation. As a result, the Canadian economy
becomes less efficient, with cost pressures for producers and consumers and
weaker business activity. Reflecting these challenges, Canadian productivity is
lower than projected in the survey forecast.
-- 264 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 255
Combining the trade uncertainty impacts and lower productivity, the downside
scenario embeds a protracted period of slower economic growth and higher
unemployment. On average, the level of Canadian nominal GDP is about
$51 billion per year below the August survey forecast from 2025 to 2029.
• 	The Canadian economy contracts in the third quarter of 2025, with activity
stalling in the fourth quarter, and remains sluggish throughout 2026 and
2027. On an annual basis, real GDP growth is 1.0 per cent in 2025, 0.6 per
cent in 2026, and 1.4 per cent in 2027. This compares to 1.1 per cent, 1.2
per cent, and 2.0 per cent for 2025, 2026, and 2027 in the August survey.
By the end of 2029, the level of real GDP is about 1.0 per cent and 2.7 per
cent lower than the forecast levels in the August survey and FES 2024,
respectively.
• 	Weaker economic activity induces businesses to slow hiring and lay off
workers, pushing the unemployment rate higher. The unemployment rate
remains elevated and above August survey expectations throughout the
forecast horizon. The unemployment rate peaks at 7.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 2025, followed by an average of 7.2 per cent in 2026 and 6.8 per
cent in 2027, compared to 6.8 per cent in 2026 and 6.4 per cent in 2027 in
the survey.
• 	As a result of weaker economic activity, CPI inflation is lower than in the
August survey, at 1.9 per cent in 2026 and 1.7 per cent in 2027, versus
2.0 per cent in both years. Typically, in a context of reduced economic
demand, the reduction in CPI inflation would be greater than is modelled in
the downside scenario. However, the downside scenario also accounts for a
reduction in potential output—arising from reduced capital investment and
lower productivity—which offsets part of the downward pressure on
inflation.
• 	In response to these developments, short-term interest rates remain lower
than the survey forecast throughout the forecast horizon. On average, in
2026 and 2027, the 3-month treasury bill rate is at 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per
cent respectively, lower than the survey forecast of 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per
cent, respectively.
• 	GDP inflation is significantly lower as Canada sees a decline in terms of trade
due to lower commodity prices and reduced CPI inflation. GDP inflation is
1.4 per cent in 2026 and 2027 versus 1.8 per cent and 2.0 per cent in the
August survey.
-- 265 of 493 --

256 ANNEX 1
Upside Scenario
In the upside scenario, trade policy uncertainty—both at home and abroad—
eases more quickly than anticipated. At home, efforts to streamline internal
trade, bolster competition, and build relationships with global partners help to
generate more predictable demand for Canadian goods. Abroad, the U.S.
reaches new trade agreements with key partners, and global trade tensions
begin to subside by late 2025. This more stable trade backdrop supports
stronger investment, higher trade flows, and improved economic confidence
worldwide.
Additionally, to reflect the ongoing government-wide effort to create a more
competitive environment, streamline regulatory processes, and make structural
reforms that remove barriers to productivity and investment, the upside
scenario illustrates how even modest improvements in productivity—measuring
how efficiently labour and capital are combined to produce goods and services—
can meaningfully expand Canada’s economic capacity and enhance long-term
resilience. This higher productivity makes Canadian goods and services more
competitive both domestically and internationally, drives private sector
investment, and creates opportunities to deliver major nation-building projects
faster and better, thereby raising Canadian incomes.
Overall, a faster normalisation of trade policy uncertainty mainly boosts
aggregate demand, while expanded productive capacity through structural
policies lifts Canada’s overall economic trajectory. On average, the level of
nominal GDP is $25 billion higher on average per year from 2025 to 2029
relative to the August survey forecast.
• 	Real GDP growth accelerates, reaching 1.2 per cent in 2025, 1.6 per cent in
2026, and 2.3 per cent in 2027, compared to 1.1 per cent, 1.2 per cent, and
2.0 per cent, respectively, in the August survey. Reflecting the compounding
effects of improved productivity, by the end of 2029, the level of real GDP is
about 0.7 per cent higher than in the August survey, although it remains
1.1 per cent lower than forecast in FES 2024.
• 	Stronger economic growth is reflected in higher job creation and greater
labour force participation. The unemployment rate declines more rapidly
than in the August survey, averaging 6.7 per cent in 2026 and 6.2 per cent in
2027, compared to 6.8 per cent and 6.4 per cent in the survey.
-- 266 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 257
• 	Upward price pressures increase as stronger aggregate demand takes hold.
However, these are largely offset by productivity gains that expand
domestic supply, keeping inflation broadly contained. As a result, CPI
inflation is 2.1 per cent in 2026 and 2.0 per cent in 2027, versus 2.0 per cent
projected in the August survey for both years.
• 	In response to these developments, short-term interest rates are only
slightly higher than the survey forecast, at 2.4 per cent in 2026 and 2.6 per
cent in 2027 compared to 2.3 per cent and 2.5 per cent in the survey.
• 	With modestly higher commodity prices and CPI inflation, GDP inflation
averages 2.1 per cent in 2026 and 2027, above the survey forecast of 1.8
per cent and 2.0 per cent, respectively.

Fiscal Impacts of Economic Scenarios
The potential impact of the economic scenarios on the projected federal deficit
and federal debt to-GDP ratio is shown in Chart A1.3 and A1.4 below.
Chart A1.3 – Federal Deficit in
Economic Scenarios
Chart A1.4 – Federal Debt-to-GDP Ratio
in Economic Scenarios
Source: Department of Finance Canada. 	Source: Department of Finance Canada.
Downside Scenario Fiscal Impact
In the downside scenario, the deficit would increase by about $9.2 billion annually,
on average, over the planning horizon. The weakened outlook for nominal GDP
would entail weaker tax revenue, and lower interest rates would result in lower
revenues from the government’s interest-bearing assets, and interest and penalty
revenue on tax debt. Overall revenues are projected to be lower by $10.4 billion,
per year. Total expenses would decrease by an average of $1.2 billion per year
over the horizon, primarily driven by reduced public debt charges from lower
interest rates and reductions in GDP-indexed transfers, partially offset by higher
pension and benefit obligation valuations from lower interest rates.
As a result of the higher deficits and weaker nominal GDP growth, the federal
debt-to-GDP ratio would be expected to rise to 45.3 per cent by 2028-29 and
fall to 45.2 per cent by 2029-30.

260 ANNEX 1
Upside Scenario Fiscal Impact
In the upside scenario, the deficit would improve by about $5.0 billion annually,
on average, over the planning horizon. Stronger nominal GDP results in higher
income tax revenues. Overall, revenues are projected to be $5.0 billion higher
annually, on average, in this scenario. Total expenses would be unchanged, on
average, with higher public debt charges and major transfers offset by lower
pension and benefit obligation valuations from higher interest rates.
As a result of the lower deficits and stronger nominal GDP, the federal debt-to-
GDP ratio would stabilise near-term and fall more rapidly from 2026-27,
reaching 42.2 by 2029-30.
Long-Term Debt Projections
Keeping the federal debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path over the long term will
help ensure that future generations are not overburdened with debt and that
sufficient fiscal room remains to address emerging fiscal pressures, challenges, and
risks.
Building on the Budget 2025 forecasts, baseline long-term fiscal projections
continue to show the federal debt-to-GDP ratio declining over the long-term
projection horizon (Chart A1.5). This conclusion is held under the downside
scenario described in the preceding section that leads to higher deficits and
federal debt-to-GDP ratios over the budget planning horizon.
Chart A1.5 – Long-Term Federal Debt Projections
Note: The downside and upside scenarios, discussed in detail in the preceding section, are extended beyond the budget
planning horizon to illustrate the long-term impact of a less and a more positive medium-term economic performance.

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 261
As with any projection that extends over several decades, the long-term debt-
to-GDP ratio projections presented in Budget 2025 are subject to a high degree
of uncertainty and are sensitive to assumptions. They should not be viewed as
predictions of the future, but instead as modelling scenarios based on a set of
reasonable economic and demographic assumptions, assuming no future
changes in policies. It is important to note that these projections do not fully
reflect positive impacts that can be expected to result from recent and future
economic policies. Some future fiscal pressures are also not accounted for in
this baseline projection, including, among others, from recessions, additional
defence spending, population aging, climate change, and the transition to net-
zero emissions.
To form the long-term economic projections, the medium-term (2025 to 2029)
economic forecasts presented in Budget 2025 are extended to 2055 using the
Department of Finance Canada’s long-term economic projection model. In this
model, annual real GDP growth depends on labour productivity growth (0.8 per
cent per year), which is calibrated over its 2000-2024 historical average, and
labour supply growth (average of 0.6 per cent per year), which is based on
demographic projections produced by Statistics Canada and projections for the
labour force participation rate and average hours worked using econometric
models developed by the Department. Assuming a constant 2 per cent annual
rate for GDP inflation, nominal GDP is projected to grow by an average of 3.5
per cent per year from 2030 to 2055 (Table A1.12).

262 ANNEX 1
The long-term federal debt projections are developed through an accounting
model in which each revenue and expense category is modelled as a function
of its underlying demographic and economic variables, with the relationships
defined by a mix of current government policies and assumptions. The key
assumptions underlying fiscal projections from 2030-31 through 2055-56 are
the following:
• 	All tax revenues as well as a direct program expenses grow broadly with
nominal GDP, with the exception of a number of programs that will no
longer be available after a certain date, such as the Clean Electricity, Clean
Technology, and Clean Hydrogen investment tax credits, which are
incorporated based on their projected costs.
• 	The Canada Health Transfer, Canada Social Transfer, and Equalization grow
with their respective legislated escalators. The remaining major transfers to
provinces, territories, and municipalities grow according to their respective
factors, such as nominal GDP, the respective populations, inflation, and
current legislation or agreements.
• 	Elderly benefits and Canada Child Benefit payments grow in line with the
respective populations and are indexed to inflation. Employment Insurance
(EI) benefits grow in line with the number of beneficiaries and the growth in
average weekly earnings. The EI premium rate grows according to current
program parameters.
• 	The effective interest rate on federal market debt is assumed, under the
baseline scenario, to gradually increase from about 3.1 per cent in 2029–30
to 3.5 per cent by 2055-56.
Sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact of changes to key assumptions on the
deficit-to-GDP and federal debt-to-GDP ratios at the end of the long-term
projection horizon (Tables A1.13 and A1.14).

Supplementary Information
Sensitivity of Fiscal Projections to Economic Shocks
Changes in economic assumptions affect the projections of revenues and expenses.
The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the projected budgetary balance to
the following economic shocks relative to Budget 2025 projections:
• 	A one-year, 1-percentage-point decrease in real GDP growth driven equally
by lower productivity and employment growth.
• 	A decrease in nominal GDP growth resulting solely from a one-year, 1-
percentage-point decrease in the rate of GDP inflation (assuming that the
Consumer Price Index moves in line with GDP inflation).
• 	A sustained 100-basis-point increase in all interest rates.
These sensitivities are estimates that assume any decrease in economic activity
is proportional across income and expenditure components and are meant to
provide a broad illustration of the impact of economic shocks on the outlook for the
budgetary balance. The sensitivity analysis conducted in this section has been
presented routinely in budgets since 1994 and is separate from the upside and
downside scenarios presented earlier in this annex. Actual economic shocks may
have different fiscal impacts. For example, they may be concentrated in specific
sectors of the economy or cause different responses in key economic variables
(e.g., GDP inflation and CPI inflation may have different responses to a given shock).
Aligned with presentation throughout Budget 2025, the fiscal sensitivities are based
on a 4-year time horizon.

A 1-percentage-point decrease in real GDP growth proportional across income
and expenditure components reduces the budgetary balance by $5.4 billion
in the first year, $5.4 billion in the second year, and $5.9 billion in the
fourth year (Table A1.15).
• 	Tax revenues from all sources fall by a total of $4.4 billion in the first year.
Personal income tax revenues decrease as employment and the underlying
tax base fall. Corporate income tax revenues fall as output and profits
decrease. GST revenues decrease because of lower consumer spending
associated with the fall in employment and personal income.
• 	EI premium revenues increase as a result of an increase in the EI premium
rate, which, under the seven-year break-even mechanism, adjusts to offset
the increase in benefits due to the higher number of unemployed, such that
the EI Operating Account balances over time.
-- 275 of 493 --

266 ANNEX 1
• 	Expenses rise, mainly reflecting higher EI benefits (due to an increase in the
number of unemployed) and higher public debt charges (reflecting a higher
stock of debt due to the lower budgetary balance). This rise is partially offset
by lower other program expenses, like Equalization, as the decline in real
GDP is reflected in nominal GDP, to which these payments are indexed.

A 1-percentage-point decrease in nominal GDP growth proportional across
income and expenditure components, resulting solely from lower GDP inflation
(assuming that the CPI moves in line with GDP inflation), lowers the budgetary
balance by $2.3 billion in the first year, $2.6 billion in the second year, and $1.0
billion in the fourth year (Table A1.16).
• 	Lower prices result in lower nominal income and, as a result, personal
income tax revenues decrease. As the parameters of the personal income tax
system are indexed to inflation, the fiscal impact is smaller than under the
real GDP shock. For the other sources of tax revenue, the negative impacts
are similar under the real and nominal GDP shocks.
-- 276 of 493 --

DETAILS OF ECONOMIC AND FISCAL PROJECTIONS 267
• 	EI premium revenues decrease in response to lower earnings.
• 	Other revenues decline slightly as lower growth in tax revenue results in
slightly lower interest and penalty revenue, and lower prices lead to lower
revenues from the sales of goods and services.
• 	Partly offsetting lower revenues are the declines in the cost of statutory
programs that are indexed to CPI inflation, such as elderly benefit payments,
which put downward pressure on federal program expenses. In addition,
other program expenses are also lower as certain programs are linked
directly to growth in nominal GDP, such as Equalization.
• 	Public debt charges decline in the first year due to lower costs associated
with Real Return Bonds.

Federal revenues 	2.5 	3.8 	6.0
Federal expenses 	7.5 	10.1 	13.8
Budgetary balance 	-4.9 	-6.3 	-7.9
A 1 per cent increase in interest rates decreases the budgetary balance by
$4.9 billion in the first year, $6.3 billion in the second year, and $7.9 billion in
the fourth year (Table A1.17). Higher interest rates directly impact estimated
public debt charges on marketable debt in two ways. First, interest costs
increase as existing debt matures and is refinanced at higher rates. Second,
rising rates increase the expected cost of future borrowing needs. Public debt
charges are estimated based on the current expectations for future changes in
interest rates, which are subject to change based on economic conditions.
It is important to note that interest rates also directly affect other government
revenues and expenses and that they typically do not change in isolation. That
is, with higher interest rates, the government would realise some offsetting
benefits, including:
• 	Higher revenues from the government’s interest-bearing assets, and interest
and penalty revenue on tax debt, which are recorded as part of other
revenues;
• 	Corresponding downward adjustments that reduce the valuations of public
sector pensions and employee benefits obligations, which are not

incorporated in the table above; and,
• 	Higher government tax revenues if interest rate increases were due to
stronger economic growth (also not included in the table above).

CAPITAL BUDGETING FRAMEWORK 281
Annex 2
Capital Budgeting Framework
Building Canada’s Productive Capacity
As announced on October 6, 2025, the government is adopting a Capital
Budgeting Framework—a new way of budgeting that makes capital investment a
national priority. This framework helps distinguish day-to-day operational
spending from capital investment (broadly defined as spending that supports
capital formation), allowing the government to identify and prioritise initiatives
that deliver long-term economic returns. The framework also increases
transparency, allowing Canadians to better understand what funds services
today, and what builds future prosperity.
An Example of Capital Investment: Expanding Airport
Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity at airports is essential for strengthening supply-chain links for
communities and businesses. Each year, operating expenses cover recurring costs
such as cargo handlers, ground support, maintenance personnel, fuel costs and
utilities to keep these cargo services running. This operating spending is
necessary for efficient and reliable service, but it does not contribute directly to
capital formation.
On the other hand, expanding cargo capacity is a capital investment. Building
warehouses, upgrading cold-chain facilities, and strengthening taxiways for
freighters create long-lived assets that transport goods more efficiently. These
upgrades reduce turnaround times and move more freight per hour—getting
goods to businesses faster and improving service reliability for communities. The
benefits compound year after year because the new assets work every day,
building value. This enhances productivity and business investment.
This is why a capital budgeting framework is important. It distinguishes day-to-
day operating dollars from the dollars that build long-lived assets, allowing the
government to prioritise the latter and help deliver lasting benefits to Canadians.
Capital investments are the building blocks to economic growth. Capital
investments boost Canada’s productivity, helping deliver more and better paying
jobs, supporting rising living standards for all Canadians over the long term. While
U.S. business investment has grown steadily, Canada’s has remained close to its
2015 levels (Chart A2.1). Canada’s growth has been held back by weak productivity
-- 291 of 493 --

associated with low investment in business capital— particularly in machinery,
equipment, and intangible assets like intellectual property (Chart A2.2). In a global
economy increasingly shaped by shifting trade dynamics and rapid adoption of
artificial intelligence, this gap weighs on competitiveness and resilience. To reverse
this trend, Canada requires a step change in capital investment, with renewed
commitment from both the public and private sectors to make growth-enhancing
capital investment a national priority. The Capital Budgeting Framework ensures
that growth and productivity are core elements of the fiscal planning architecture
across the federal government.

The Capital Budgeting Framework builds on established public financial
management practices used in advanced economies and adapts them to a made-
in-Canada approach. As an example, the United Kingdom separates capital
spending (investment in long-lived assets) from current spending for planning,
reporting, and control, consistent with their national macroeconomic accounts.
Singapore similarly distinguishes operating from “development” expenditures,
defined as long-term investments that advance economic development and
welfare. In Singapore, the government may borrow only to finance “nationally
significant” capital investments, while other spending must generally be covered
by revenues. The objective is fiscal sustainability and intergenerational fairness,
so that debt incurred today is tied to assets that benefit future generations.

1 	Spending in the main budget tables is generally not split between operating and capital, and the
key fiscal metrics are using the same accounting basis for reporting actual financial results under
the Canadian public sector accounting standards. However, provinces also present a capital or
infrastructure plan either as part of their main budget document or separately.
2 	Not all provinces have an explicit deficit constraint.
3 	For comparison purposes, refers only to capital assets to be amortised over their useful lives
under each jurisdiction’s accounting practices.
4 	The United Kingdom budget explicitly presents in its main budget tables the net acquisition of
capital (i.e., excluding amortisation) as part of its “public sector net investment” fiscal metric,
which is excluded from its stability (current budget) rule.
5 	In Singapore, only a small fraction of capital spending is excluded from the country’s “balanced
budget over each term of government” constraint. It is limited to “nationally significant” projects
(≥ S$4 billion, ≥ 50-year life, productivity or sustainability benefits, government-owned) and
subject to a hard S$90 billion cap. The budget impact from these projects is from amortising the
assets over their useful life after construction.
6 	Canadian provinces generally present amounts associated with the acquisition of tangible capital
assets in their capital or infrastructure plan, but not in the main budget tables. In alignment with
Canadian public sector accounting standards, amortisation expense, rather than acquisition cost
is included in the provinces’ key budgetary balance metrics.
7 	Considered in the federal Capital Budgeting Framework through capital amortisation only.
8 	Some provinces include intangible capital assets in their capital or infrastructure plans.
9 	Some provinces do present capital transfers to municipalities and the private sector as part of
their capital or infrastructure plans. These transfers are included in the budgetary balance,
reflecting the same accounting principles for reporting actual financial results, and, when
applicable, are subject to the deficit constraint.

284 ANNEX 2
Definition and Categories
The Capital Budgeting Framework establishes a consistent way to classify
spending, including tax expenditures, that contributes to capital formation—
referred to here as capital investment—while maintaining pre-existing categories
used in budgets and financial reports.
Capital investments, for the purposes of the framework, are defined broadly as
any government expenditures or tax incentives that contribute to public or
private sector capital formation, held directly on the government’s balance sheet
or on that of a private sector entity, Indigenous community or another level of
government. Within this broad definition, the focus is on capital investments
that meet the following criteria:
• 	Conditionality – whether the funding recipient is required to invest in
capital formation to receive the benefit.
• 	Clear linkage – whether the spending encourages or enables capital
investment in identifiable sectors or projects.
Applying this definition, federal government spending classified as capital
investment is categorised as follows:
• 	Capital transfers – transfers to other levels of government and
organisations expressly intended for the recipient to invest in infrastructure
or a productive asset.
◦ 	Transfer payments, and other forms of support, are classified as
capital investments when the recipient (e.g., a province or territory,
an Indigenous community, an arms-length or private organisation) is
required to use the funds to build, acquire, or better capital assets,
with reporting to the federal government for monitoring.
Unrestricted transfers count towards the day-to-day operating
budget. For Indigenous infrastructure, including transfers under
modern treaties, self-government, new fiscal relationships, and
similar arrangements, the conditionality criterion is applied in a
manner consistent with self-determination.
-- 294 of 493 --

CAPITAL BUDGETING FRAMEWORK 285
• 	Capital-focused tax incentives – tax expenditures intended to incentivise
new capital formation.
◦ 	Tax expenditures (predominantly corporate income-tax related) are
classified as capital investments when the measure directly
incentivises investment in capital rather than ongoing operations.
• 	Amortisation of federal capital assets – expenses recorded to spread the
cost of capital assets owned or controlled by the federal government over
their useful lives.
◦ 	This is aligned with existing reporting of amortisation of federal capital
assets in the Public Accounts of Canada, which is based on Canadian
public sector accounting standards.
◦ 	Examples of federal capital assets include buildings, machinery and
equipment, aircraft, etc.
• 	Private sector research and development – direct funding, or tax
incentives, for research and development (R&D) activities that enable
commercialisation or scale-up and raise future productive capacity.
◦ 	Private sector R&D is emphasised given its closer link to
commercialisation and production, and more direct tie to asset formation.
• 	Support to unlock large-scale private sector capital investment
– contractual agreements with proponents involving exceptional, significant
operating subsidies designed to unlock incremental large-scale private
capital investments.
◦ 	Although these transfers to private sector entities are expressly
intended to support operating costs, they are delivered under a
contractual agreement requiring the recipient to make prescribed
capital investments and are therefore classified as capital investment
under the framework.
• 	Measures to grow the housing stock – measures that accelerate new
housing supply.
◦ 	Initiatives that contribute to private sector capital formation, such as
building new homes, as well as those that lift construction
productivity through significant at-scale programs.
Spending not classified as capital investment is considered day-to-day operating
spending. This includes major government expenditures like transfers to
persons, health and social transfers, and the costs of running government

operations and services, including salaries and benefits. This spending remains
essential for service delivery and accounts for the bulk of government spending .
Consistent with the presentation of the federal budget, under the Capital
Budgeting Framework projected costs of capital investments are determined on
a full accrual basis of accounting. Using a consistent basis of accounting makes it
easier to understand how changes in capital investments impact the budgetary
balance, and promotes comparability.
Projected fiscal costs of capital investments over the budget horizon are
generally similar on cash and accrual bases for a given year, except for mostly
temporary timing differences for federal capital assets, loans and guarantees.
For example, under accrual accounting, the cost (cash basis) of acquiring federal
land, buildings, equipment and other capital property, like bridges is capitalised,
recorded as an asset and, except for land, amortised to expense (accrual basis)
over the useful life of the capital property. For loans, cash impacts reflect the
disbursement and repayment of loans, whereas accrual costs reflect allowances
recorded to reflect concessionary terms and collectability and risk of loss.
On a cash basis, the total fiscal cost of capital investments included in Budget
2025 would be about $450.6 billion over five years.
Detailed Outlook for Capital Investments
Table A2.2 provides further detail on projections for major capital investments,
organised by the framework’s six categories. Historical information is provided
in Table A2.3. Unless otherwise specified, these projections are based on
Department of Finance estimates. In the coming months, the Department will
work with the Treasury Board Secretariat and participating organisations to
develop an ongoing reporting approach for capital investments, leveraging
existing sources wherever possible.
Capital investments over the budget horizon account for a larger share of
spending than during the previous 20 years. With measures in the budget,
annual capital investment will also nearly double from $32.2 billion in 2024-25
to $59.6 billion in 2029-30 (Chart A2.3).

CAPITAL BUDGETING FRAMEWORK 291
Historical Information
Table A2.3 includes a backward-looking application of the Capital Budgeting
Framework to the past twenty years. This history traces the fiscal cost of the
programs identified as baseline capital investments in Table A2.2 and their
readily identifiable precursors. For example, while the Scientific Research and
Experimental Development (SR&ED) program has supported private sector
research and development for decades, other capital investment programs are
newer, such as the Strategic Innovation Fund which incorporated several legacy
programs and has now been replaced by the Strategic Response Fund. In these
cases, Table A2.3 includes both current and predecessor programs.

COMPREHENSIVE EXPENDITURE REVIEW 	295
Agriculture and Agri-Food
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Agriculture and
Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) will reorient its programming, scientific research, and
operational expenditures to better align with the government’s priorities, while
continuing to collaborate with provinces, territories, and industry to ensure
program delivery meets evolving sector needs. AAFC will wind down some
programs outside its core mandate, such as the Agricultural Climate Solution
Living Labs. The government is focusing on supports for producers and agri-
businesses to innovate, adopt clean technologies and stay competitive in a
shifting global market, ensuring Canada remains a leader in sustainable food
production.
AAFC will also reduce certain science activities where a more streamlined
approach can be taken, or where capacity exists elsewhere, for example in
academia and industry. AAFC will focus on core priority areas, and streamline its
science operations to make them more cost-effective for the long-term. AAFC
will continue its scientific work in crops and horticulture, animal production,
food, biodiversity and environmental sustainability, often in partnership with
industry, for projects that are priorities for the sector. AAFC will also continue
to fund science and innovation through grants and contributions.
AAFC will also improve operational efficiency by optimising internal services to
align resources with departmental priorities, rationalising administrative support
and reducing management layers, advancing technology and automation to cut
down on time-consuming manual work, and reducing reliance on external
contractors. Through process improvement and leveraging technology, AAFC
will be able to operate at reduced resource levels while minimizing impacts on
its external service delivery.

296 ANNEX THREE
Canada Revenue Agency
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) administers tax, benefits and related
programs on behalf of federal, provincial, and territorial governments across
Canada, contributing to the ongoing economic and social well-being of
Canadians. The Agency’s core responsibility for tax and benefits includes taking
compliance and enforcement actions when necessary to uphold the integrity of
the system.
The CRA will modernize its administrative approach to enable greater
productivity, and wind down its business units that are no longer connected to
government priorities. This includes the Digital Services Tax, the Federal Fuel
Charge, and the Canada Carbon Rebate for individuals and for businesses.
Budget 2025 also proposes to eliminate the inefficient Underused Housing Tax
and luxury tax on aircraft and vessels, which will result in administrative savings.
A portion of these savings will be reinvested to improve services, strengthen
compliance, and reduce tax debt. AI and process automation will be leveraged to
transform technologies, data and analytics systems for compliance and
collection activities. This will free up resources to tackle complex cases requiring
human intervention and to address the backlog of tax debt. For example, by
automating certain tasks in the risk scoring process, CRA estimates that
repetitive tasks will be reduced by 50 per cent once fully implemented. This
reinvestment will help protect the tax base, with an estimated positive fiscal
impact of $1.1 billion annually from 2028-29 onwards.

Canadian Heritage
Department of Canadian Heritage
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Department
of Canadian Heritage (PCH) will refocus its cultural programming to meet the
evolving needs of recipients and ensure program effectiveness. The funding
envelope of the Canada Cultural Spaces Fund will be reduced and reoriented to
focus solely on funding specialized equipment in the cultural sector, offering a
cost-effective way to upgrade cultural facilities. The Canada Periodical Fund will
be refocused to incentivize the creation of original Canadian editorial content
only, no longer funding paid subscriptions and single-copy sales. This approach
prioritizes production of quality Canadian editorial and journalistic content,
regardless of the platform. The government remains committed to arts and
culture, with proposed funding in Budget 2025 for the cultural economy and
CBC/Radio-Canada.
To ensure efficiency, effectiveness and alignment with its core mandate, PCH
will reorganize its internal services and program administration to consolidate
efforts, reduce overlap, and modernize workflows. PCH will transform its
transfer payment delivery model, standardizing processes, consolidating
functions, and replacing fragmented systems with a modern digital platform.
Savings will also be achieved by refocusing on core priorities, including the
closing of the Gift Bank for Ministers and senior officials and transitioning to a
focus on digital interpretation products, which will support a wide variety of
languages, including Indigenous languages.
The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission will also be
employing AI in the operations of the Spam Reporting Centre to continue to
protect Canadians from unsolicited commercial communications in a more
efficient, cost-effective manner.
Parks Canada Agency
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Parks Canada
Agency (PC) will maximize efficiencies while continuing to deliver services to
Canadians by refocusing its organisational structure and business unit functions
to avoid duplication of work, as well as ceasing or reducing lower priority
activities, such as library services.

Employment and Workforce Development
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Employment and
Social Development Canada (ESDC) will implement operational efficiencies and
a targeted recalibration of its programs and its approach to delivering them, with
a focus on ensuring that government funding generates real results for
Canadians in core areas of federal responsibility. These efficiencies will be
advanced while continuing to empower workers in Budget 2025 by expanding
the Union Training and Innovation Program to boost union-based
apprenticeship training in the Red Seal trades and investing in a Foreign
Credential Recognition Action Fund to help qualified foreign-trained
professionals contribute more quickly to Canada’s workforce.
To improve its efficiency, ESDC will increase its use of artificial intelligence to
streamline and automate internal processes, reduce its real property portfolio by
decreasing general office space, consolidate management and administrative
support functions, reduce reliance on external consultants, and limit travel and
conference attendance. ESDC will also streamline program delivery by
consolidating the Canada Service Corps program and the Supports for Student
Learning Program to bring down administration costs.
ESDC will also increase its focus on core federal responsibilities and reduce or
eliminate spending where it is duplicated by other federal departments or
provinces and territories.
ESDC will shift funding away from programs where there is reduced or limited
need. To ensure funding goes to programs with the greatest impact, ESDC will
decrease funding to underperforming programs and those with limited
effectiveness and overlap with other federal initiatives.

Energy and Natural Resources
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Natural Resources
Canada (NRCan) will optimize internal processes to reduce administrative
burden, reducing management layers, and adopting new approaches to leverage
AI. The department will also prioritize its science mandate and consolidate
operations of the Office of the Surveyor General in the North.
NRCan will streamline its suite of programming, winding down several programs
like the Canada Greener Homes Grant. In addition, the department will
recalibrate its support under certain programs to prioritize projects that deliver
the most benefits for Canadians.
NRCan will also end the 2 Billion Trees program. Existing contribution
agreements and commitments will be honoured, and uncommitted funds will be
returned. The government remains committed to sustainable forest
management practices – to date, the program has committed to planting nearly
1 billion trees.
These efforts will better orient the work of the department to advance the
government’s new climate competitiveness strategy, including supporting
critical minerals projects, and free up resources to drive investment in clean
growth projects. In Budget 2025, the government will provide $2 billion, on a
cash basis, starting in 2026-27, to NRCan to create the Critical Minerals
Sovereign Fund to make strategic investments in critical minerals projects and
companies.

Environment and Climate Change
The Climate Competitiveness Strategy outlines how the government is
committed to continuing to spur the investments needed to achieve a net-zero
economy, including through Investment Tax Credits.
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years and streamline
program delivery, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) will
prioritize activities within its core mandate. This includes reducing or winding
down activities and programming that are not core to the Department’s
mandate or which can be delivered more effectively through another
department. ECCC will continue its important work on Indigenous engagement,
but will consolidate this function, which is currently distributed across teams in
the Department. ECCC will also streamline its nature programming to simplify
engagement with stakeholders and reduce administrative burden.
ECCC will improve day-to-day operating efficiency by eliminating redundancies
and standardizing administrative support. It will reduce its physical footprint by
ending some small lease agreements and eliminating external training contracts
in favour of in-house activities. Standardizing support models and consolidating
functions will streamline operations and enable better integration of automation
tools.

Fisheries and Oceans
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Department
of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) will wind down research and monitoring
activities that have either achieved their objectives or for which alternative data
sources exist, scale back certain policy and program capabilities, reduce
management layers, and right-size internal services.
In addition, DFO will leverage artificial intelligence and other digital tools to
modernize Canada’s fisheries management system. Reducing the use of
burdensome paper-based tools will free up time for fisheries officers to spend in
communities and on the water enforcing fisheries regulations.
DFO will also reduce reviews and formal authorizations required for small,
routine, low-risk projects—such as culverts and drains—by providing
standardized guidance that will enable project proponents to self-assess
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Simplifying these reviews,
which require disproportionate administrative effort, will allow DFO to focus on
projects that pose a higher risk to fish and their habitat. As outlined in Budget
2025, the government will ensure harbours are fully operated, in good working
condition, and managed and maintained by self-sufficient harbour authorities
who represent the interests of users and communities.

Global Affairs
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Global Affairs
Canada (GAC) is refocusing Canada’s international presence in the areas of
advocacy, security, and development, as well as implementing targeted reforms
across its trade and investment portfolio to better align with current strategic
priorities and the geo-political context.
As part of these adjustments, there will be reductions in development funding to
global health programming, where Canada’s contribution has grown
disproportionately relative to other similar economies, and to some international
financial institutions, which receive significant support through other sources, and
where Canada’s contributions can be leveraged further. Some bilateral development
programs will also be refined and adjusted. These changes are expected to re-
baseline the International Assistance Envelope to pre-COVID levels.
GAC will implement reforms across its trade and investment portfolio, including
modernising the Trade Commissioner Service, and refocusing certain trade
support programs. Collectively, these measures aim to reduce duplication, lower
administrative overhead and focus efforts on high-impact services for Canadian
businesses.
GAC will also implement a range of measures to find efficiencies across
Canada’s mission network, including revamping emergency preparedness and
Modernising consular services. It will reduce its mission expenditures through a
number of strategies, including consolidating embassies with multiple properties
into fewer buildings, acquiring Crown-owned properties in certain cases, and co-
locating some offices with allies where appropriate.

Canadian Food Inspection Agency
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) will reduce overlap and duplication within the

consolidating lab services to focus on essential testing and avoid the need for
costly capital upgrades. At the same time, investments in secure digital
platforms and export certificate digitalisation will be made to increase
efficiencies and better support our exporters.
CFIA will also implement changes to certain areas of program delivery to realize
additional efficiencies and modernize its programs, while maintaining its focus
on core activities and high-risk priorities. This includes moving from paper-based
pet export certificates to modernised digital platforms that improve
convenience, reduce delays, and enhance service quality, as well as reducing
overlap in some animal disease testing. Activities that will be phased out include
decommissioning some vehicle washing stations, discontinuing duplicative
dispute resolution services over food grade, and winding down functions that
are no longer required to address health risk linked to the trade of pets.

Public Health Agency of Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC) will implement operational efficiencies and a targeted
recalibration of its programs, while preserving critical functions that keep
Canadians safe.
PHAC will streamline its program delivery by consolidating grants and
contributions programs into larger funds. While these new funds will operate
with a lower overall funding envelope once temporary funding ends, their
impact will be increased by targeting investments to core federal public health
priorities that are central to PHAC’s mandate, supporting delivery partners that
demonstrate clear and measurable public health outcomes aligned with the new
funds’ objectives, and leveraging increased program flexibility and
responsiveness.
As PHAC transitions from peak-pandemic operations to a more sustainable
federal posture, it will allow some temporary funding to end and will optimize
contracting based on demand forecasts and procurement strategies. This
approach will minimize waste and costs without compromising public health.
PHAC will also reduce its back-office costs by standardizing administrative
processes, streamlining roles and responsibilities, leveraging enhanced IT
solutions, and eliminating redundancies.
In addition, the Patented Medical Prices Review Board will modernise its
hearings by leveraging existing technology, enabling faster and more cost-
effective procedural processes.

Housing, Infrastructure and Communities
Housing, Infrastructure and Communities Canada
Budget 2025 will reorient how the government delivers infrastructure funding
to support needs across the country. This will help Housing, Infrastructure and
Communities Canada (HICC) to deliver on significant generational investments,
including launching the Build Communities Strong Fund to invest in a growing
Canadian economy.
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, there will be a
realignment to current HICC programming. This includes implementing three
horizontal efficiency initiatives to review the executive cadre, with the goal of
streamlining management and operations.
HICC will prioritize two services as part of the Climate Toolkit for Housing and
Infrastructure, specifically the online Climate Insight Platform and the Roster of
Experts. This approach will provide local communities with easy access to
current information, tools and resources, while offering those with limited
capacity timely technical advice and guidance through the Roster of Experts.
A portion of uncommitted funding from the Canada Public Transit Fund will be
reallocated to the Build Communities Strong Fund where transit projects will
continue to be eligible. Further, the Minister of Housing and Infrastructure will
identify opportunities to streamline burdensome requirements in the existing
Canada Public Transit Fund to accelerate delivery of projects and help our cities,
provinces and territories build new projects faster and better.
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation
Canada’s housing challenges have evolved, and so must the Canada Mortgage
and Housing Corporation (CMHC), as a key partner in finding solutions. The
government has announced Build Canada Homes which will partner with
industry, other levels of government, and Indigenous communities to build
affordable housing at scale and at speed.
With an initial investment of $13 billion over five years on a cash basis, starting
in 2025-26, Build Canada Homes provides an opportunity to re-evaluate
CMHC’s resources and programming to ensure they are aligned with this
important priority.
-- 319 of 493 --

310 ANNEX THREE
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, CMHC will wind
down certain programs that do not directly increase housing supply or target
Canadians in housing need. The Canada Secondary Suite Loan program, which is
not yet operational, will not be implemented as it has a large potential to overlap
with the government’s homeowner insured mortgage rule changes announced in
January 2025. For other programs it is proposing to wind down, the objectives
will be achieved by Build Canada Homes.
CMHC will maintain its funding for initiatives that address the housing crisis,
including the Apartment Construction Loan Program and supports to increase
access to housing for Indigenous people residing in urban, rural and northern
regions.

Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Immigration,
Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is rationalizing programming, while
upholding the government’s long-standing commitment to resettle the world’s
most vulnerable. This includes targeted adjustments to programs, including
adjusting the Interim Housing Assistance Program commensurate with the
decline in asylum claimants.
To reduce duplication and streamline delivery, IRCC will transfer responsibility
for employer-focused compliance inspections under the International Mobility
Program (IMP) to Employment and Social Development Canada. Both
organizations conduct parallel inspections under separate programs (the IMP
and the Temporary Foreign Worker Program), using similar tools and authorities,
resulting in duplication of effort, oversight, and internal service demands. This
change would simplify the compliance landscape for employers, while
supporting more coherent federal oversight.
IRCC will also readjust the Settlement Program to implement limits to program
eligibility for economic immigrants. The program will continue to support most
recent arrivals to overcome barriers in integrating into Canadian society. IRCC
will also introduce a modest co-payment model to its Interim Federal Health
Program for supplemental health products or services (such as prescription
medication and dental care).
Finally, IRCC will streamline its internal services – using technology to improve

Innovation, Science and Industry
Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Innovation,
Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) will reorient its skills
programming to avoid duplication, while seeking to limit impacts on
stakeholders and clients. Focusing on initiatives that have achieved their goals
or are no longer fit-for-purpose, ISED will reduce or wind down certain
programming. These actions to be more efficient are complemented by the
government’s recent investment of $5 billion over six years, starting in 2025-26,
for the Strategic Response Fund which will provide flexible terms to help firms
in all sectors and regions impacted by tariffs to adapt, diversify, and grow.
ISED will reprioritize its science and industry programming to improve alignment
with its core mandate and reduce overlap with other federal, provincial, and
territorial investments. This will include, among other things, not renewing
certain funding envelopes in the Global Innovation Clusters and the Strategic
Innovation Fund, namely the Net Zero Accelerator due to declining demand,
where initiatives have accomplished their goals or may be superseded by other
programming.
To better align its programs with current priorities and reduce redundancies,
ISED will transfer the Canadian Small Business Financing Program to the
Business Development Bank of Canada. ISED will also streamline its business
support services, such as Digital Services to Business, to improve efficiency.
Targeted reductions will be made in certain entrepreneurial and innovation
programs as well as at the Canada Foundation for Innovation.
Finally, ISED will realize additional savings by reducing its operational and capital
footprint to become more agile and improve service delivery. This will include
streamlining administrative functions, flattening management structures,
reducing specialized personnel, and lowering reliance on external consultants.
National Research Council of Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the National
Research Council of Canada (NRC) will reorganize its operations and research
activities to focus on the most relevant and impactful areas. This includes
divesting from some research capabilities, including exploring options to best
position the Canadian Photonics Fabrication Centre to attract private capital,

scale its operations, and serve as a platform for Canadian innovation and new
photonic applications, including in the face of the rise of AI and related compute
infrastructure.
NRC will focus its Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) by adjusting
contributions to some program streams, while not impacting strategic sectors.
This approach will ensure equitable support across industries or regions, while
preserving IRAP’s capacity to identify and invest in new, emerging technologies,
and keep pace with the speed of industry.
NRC will also redistribute capabilities to enable more effective service delivery
while allowing the most strategic activities to be maintained, including delivering
an ambitious defence industrialization agenda, and optimizing research centre
operations.
Statistics Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Statistics Canada
(StatsCan) will increase the efficiency of its statistical programs by adopting new
tools and methods to reduce costs while continuing to deliver relevant and high-
quality data for Canadians. For example, the frequency of data collection will be
reduced where the requirements can be met through statistical modelling or
other modern methods. In addition, adjustments will be made to the frequency
and level of detail collected for data sets which demonstrate less relevance to
Canadians.
StatsCan will also modernize processes, flatten management structures, and
modernize its internal services. These changes will build on the agency’s prior
strategic investments in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, machine
learning and automation, which have already been shown to improve
operational efficiency and responsiveness.
Collectively, these measures will ensure that the agency remains sustainable and
focused on delivering the most critical and relevant data for Canadians.
Statistics Canada’s commitment to quality, integrity, and evidence-based
support for government and Canadians will remain unchanged.

Justice
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Department
of Justice will introduce process efficiencies and standardization, which will
include amalgamating business units, reducing redundancies, imposing leaner
management and leveraging AI. These investments in AI, specifically advanced
analytics and automation tools, will help address the growing demand for legal
services more efficiently.
To more effectively deliver legal services, the Department of Justice will explore
opportunities to review limits to access the informal procedure in income tax
and GST appeals at the Tax Court of Canada. Increasing these limits, which have
not been updated since 2013, will promote cost-effective dispute resolution,
and lower litigation cost for Canadians and Canadian businesses and the federal
government. These changes will require legislative amendments.
The Canadian Human Rights Commission is introducing an organizational
realignment and implementing a more streamlined structure, which includes
consolidating the roles of the Chief Commissioner and Deputy Chief
Commissioner.

COMPREHENSIVE EXPENDITURE REVIEW 	317
National Defence
Our Government is making a generational investment in defence that will create
good, high-paying careers for Canadians, and strengthen our economy and
collective resilience. Recognizing its essential mandate to protect our
sovereignty and secure our borders, the Department of National Defence (DND)
was provided with a reduction target of 2 per cent of its review base.
Streamlining and recalibrating current spending that is not cost effective will
free up resources that could be reinvested in defence and help Canada achieve
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Defence Investment Pledge.
To achieve savings, DND will retire selected fleets that are nearing the end of
their service lives, face rising sustainment costs, and that either no longer align
with future Canadian Armed Forces operational requirements or for which
replacement capabilities have already been identified. Retiring these increasingly
costly platforms, which have diminishing strategic value, will ensure that
resources are focused on acquiring and fielding modern capabilities for the
Canadian Armed Forces.
In parallel, DND will readjust its real property portfolio through divestment of
underutilized, obsolete or surplus assets. Where appropriate, divested assets
may be repurposed by other levels of government or the private sector, creating
additional public value.
DND will also expand the use of the proven Energy Performance Contract
model to retrofit defence facilities with energy-efficient systems financed by
third-party Energy Service Companies who are repaid directly from guaranteed
utility cost savings. This is a scalable and low-risk solution that reduces recurring
costs, modernizes defence infrastructure, and advances Canada’s climate
commitments while ensuring fiscal discipline.
Finally, DND will modernize governance practices and internal services to
address systemic inefficiencies that create bottlenecks and contribute to project
delivery delays that result in increased costs. Reducing these administrative
burdens will allow DND and its partners to focus on execution rather than
process and accelerate the delivery of new capabilities.
-- 327 of 493 --

The Canadian Coast Guard joined DND on September 2, 2025. As it integrates
with the defence team, opportunities to improve efficiency and effectiveness

Privy Council
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Privy Council
Office (PCO) will recalibrate to programming that is no longer a priority or has
objectives that overlap and could be better delivered by other departments,
such as the Clean Growth Office and PCO programming for Public Lands and
Housing.
PCO will also modernize its organization to deliver efficiencies, including
automating external correspondence, modernising the administration of
Governor in Council appointees, and improving its processes to support Cabinet
Committees. PCO will also consolidate its internal services, including human
resources, finance and information technology.
PCO will revisit its programs where functions may be overlapping and
duplicative with what is delivered by other organizations. For example, this
could include working with security partners to rationalize resources dedicated
to analysing intelligence information within government.

320 ANNEX THREE
Public Safety
Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness
To strengthen its mandate to keep Canadians safe from a range of risks,
including natural disasters, crime and terrorism, while meeting up to 15 per cent
in savings targets over three years, Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness
(PSEP) will work to become a leaner, more efficient department to better serve
Canadians. This will be done by rightsizing leadership by reducing executive and
administrative roles to flatten organizational structures and enhance
productivity, consolidating internal functions to eliminate duplication and
improve service delivery and discontinuing services with minimal operational
impact, such as the Centre for Resilience and Continuity Management and the
Public Safety Library. PSEP will also leverage technology and AI to automate
tasks, and reduce software licensing requirements to achieve savings.
PSEP will also refocus on core aspects of federal emergency management
responsibilities. Emergency management functions and programs at PSEP have
evolved in response to growing risks and demands. However, this evolution has
often been fragmented—units have adapted independently while others have
remained unchanged despite shifting priorities. At the same time, emerging
priorities—such as national readiness and response capacity—require sustained
attention and dedicated resources. Modernising the organisational structure will
address inefficiencies and create space to strategically advance critical and
emergencies priorities.
Canada Border Services Agency
Recognizing its essential mandate to protect our sovereignty and secure our
border and keep communities safe, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA)
was provided with a reduction target of 2 per cent of its review base. Proposed
savings will not impact border security, revenue collection or commercial
facilitation operations.
-- 330 of 493 --

COMPREHENSIVE EXPENDITURE REVIEW 	321
To achieve operating efficiencies, CBSA will reduce the cost of using and
maintaining its equipment and IT assets by decommissioning legacy software
applications. Recognizing the lifecycle of vehicles in Canada, CBSA will reduce
the pace of replacing fleet vehicles—extending its fleet lifecycle from 7 to 10
years and will review the structure of its national headquarters to standardize
organizational structures. It will reduce discretionary spending on travel and
training, and review overtime spending, while assigning resources with a focus
on service delivery needs (e.g., border wait times or other performance metrics)
when making decisions on overtime spending.
These efficiencies will complement measures announced by the Prime Minister
on October 17, 2025 to provide $617.7 million over five years, starting in 2025-
26, with $51.3 million in remaining amortisation and $198.3 million ongoing
through Budget 2025 to support CBSA core operations and increase the CBSA’s
recruit stipend. This funding is complementary to the $1.3 billion Border Plan
announced in December 2024, which together will allow the CBSA to hire up to
1,000 new officers.
Correctional Service Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Correctional
Service Canada (CSC) will transform the way it works through greater
integration of its programming and case management, better use of digital tools,
and by realigning and Modernising its internal services, to improve efficiency
and outcomes.
In addition, operational efficiencies will be realized through efforts such as the
restructuring of the Parole Officer orientation training, which will modernize
delivery, tailor content, and better support new officers in their roles.
CSC’s internal services teams will refocus on critical priorities, flatten
organizational structures, align with modern practices, and reduce administrative
burden. This will include optimization of its office footprint and a reorganization
of its regional arrangements to improve efficiency, consistency, and
accountability in its work. This renewed structure and way of working will
strengthen CSC’s ability to build partnerships (e.g., with provinces, territories,
Indigenous governments, and community organizations) and make the
organization more agile.
-- 331 of 493 --

322 ANNEX THREE
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Recognizing its essential mandate to keep Canadians safe and secure and protect
our sovereignty, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) was provided with a
reduction target of 2 per cent of its review base. Proposed savings will not impact
policing operations. Budget 2025 makes significant investments in the RCMP to
expand its capacity by hiring 1,000 personnel to increase federal policing capacity
across Canada to combat crime.
The RCMP will reduce expenditures at its national headquarters by centralizing,
restructuring and right-sizing key national and administrative functions by
Modernising processes and more effectively using existing tools, technology and
systems.
The RCMP will also adjust how it delivers the Cannabis for Medical Purposes
benefit. Currently, the program reimburses medical cannabis at a rate of $8.50
per gram, which is significantly above the market price. RCMP will transition to
reimburse at $6.00 per gram – which still remains above, but closer to the
market price. This adjustment maintains existing entitlements to meet the needs
of RCMP members, while ensuring the government is paying a fair price to
provide this support. For those members who already purchase medical
cannabis for $6.00 per gram or less, they will see no change.
Government of Canada benefits are generally escalated annually using the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), with limited exceptions. CPI is widely considered to be
the most accurate and transparent measure to ensure that benefits keep up with
the cost of living. As part of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review, the
government announces its intention to propose amendments to index Disability
Pension benefits to the CPI for RCMP serving and retired members. These changes
will ensure benefits are indexed in a transparent manner consistent with approaches
used for other benefits such as the Canada Child Benefit, Old Age Security, federal
government pension plans, and well as the Canada Pension Plan.
For the adjustment to the disability pension indexation and the Cannabis for
Medical Purposes benefit, savings represent actuarial accounting adjustments of
employee future benefits. Savings on a cash basis will be gradual, being realized
over time as benefit payments are issued at a lower rate compared to the current
status quo.

Public Services and Procurement
Public Services and Procurement Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Public Services
and Procurement Canada (PSPC) will undertake strategic realignments to reduce
ongoing costs to operate programs and efficiently deliver services as a common
service provider for the government. PSPC will reduce ongoing costs for its Real
Property Revolving Fund, by focusing on core mandates, Modernising
operations, and reducing duplicative functions. PSPC will wind down activities
of the Canada General Standards Board, as this optional service will be better
served via alternative organizations given that there are 15 other accredited
Standards Development Organizations operating in Canada.
To further achieve efficiencies, PSPC will reduce funding to pilot and innovation
projects for Laboratories Canada.
PSPC will also review its internal processes to reduce administrative
requirements, and delayer management. It will advance digital delivery of
procurement-related documents and better manage project delivery, and reduce
spending on professional services and travel. The Department will also
implement the use of AI chat bots and self-service tools to improve service
delivery.
These measures to enhance efficiency will support PSPC’s delivery of the Buy
Canadian Policy, as announced by the Prime Minister on September 5, 2025.
Shared Services Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Shared Services
Canada (SSC) will be implementing efficiencies government-wide by
standardizing platforms, including realigning enterprise software offerings to
match current needs, eliminating low-use or redundant licences, and eliminating
non-essential fixed lines.
-- 334 of 493 --

COMPREHENSIVE EXPENDITURE REVIEW 	325
SSC will also retire outdated technologies, systems and infrastructure that are
costly to operate, difficult to secure, and limit innovation. This includes
migrating workloads and hardware from remaining legacy data centres into
modern facilities to reduce outage risks to support critical services, and shrink
the government’s costly legacy IT footprint. SSC will review, consolidate and
renegotiate contracts to eliminate duplication, secure better pricing, and align
spending with enterprise needs. By transitioning to modernized, cost-effective
solutions, significant savings will be achieved through ending or reducing
support for legacy systems, which are often expensive to maintain and operate
due to outdated technologies and higher risks of system failure.
To modernize workflows, reduce manual effort and optimize service delivery,
SSC will leverage emerging technologies to automate repetitive tasks, use AI-
driven tools to optimize operations and service delivery, automating common IT
support requests to reduce call volumes and costs while improving user
experience.
SSC will also build up its in-house capacity and expertise to reduce spending on
external consultants and contractors for ongoing operations. By developing
internal skills, re-skilling staff, and optimizing resource allocation, SSC will lower
contracted service costs while strengthening institutional knowledge.

Transport
Transport Canada
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Transport Canada
(TC) will implement a more modern and flexible regulatory and oversight regime
that will allow the department to respond to rapid technological change,
modernize services, facilitate regulatory compliance, and allocate resources
more efficiently. These actions will help Transport Canada deliver for Canadians,
including through the new Trade Diversification Corridors Fund – a fund of $5
billion over seven years, starting in 2025-26, to strengthen supply chains, unlock
new export opportunities and build a more resilient, diversified economy.
Capitalizing on the work under the Government’s Reducing Regulatory Red
Tape initiative, TC will deploy advanced technology and automation, where
possible, to reduce duplication, modernize processes, and more closely align
activities with the department’s mandate to support a safe and secure, efficient
and environmentally responsible transportation system. This integration of
innovative practices and technologies with TC’s expert workforce will also
maximize the impact of its oversight and inspection efforts while seeking to
reduce regulatory burden on industries.
TC will also further refine its program portfolio to better align with its core
mandate and with evolving industry needs. As part of this strategic realignment,
TC will phase out, or reduce, selected programs that overlap with initiatives that
are better delivered by other departments, or which have successfully fulfilled
their objectives. This includes the Incentives for Medium- and Heavy-Duty
Zero-Emission Vehicles program, which will conclude at the end of 2025-26.
TC will also implement a series of initiatives to reorient its operations and
administrative structures. This includes consolidating management layers,
centralizing internal services, and restructuring regional offices to ensure they
reflect Canada’s evolving transportation landscape. TC’s aviation services, which
provide a range of aviation services to government departments and agencies,
will be restructured, transferring most core aviation services functions and
assets to the Department of National Defence, while seeking to leverage
commercial offerings where appropriate. The high standard of training and
certification of pilots will be maintained, with no impact on commercial and non-
commercial pilots in Canada.

Canadian Air Transport Security Authority
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Canadian Air
Transport Security Authority (CATSA) will deliver efficiencies without impacting
the public, air travelers and stakeholders. CATSA will reduce its day-to-day
expenses by minimizing spending on professional services, leveraging
technology to automate certain processes and functions, and modernising its
organizational structure.
CATSA will also work with Transport Canada to implement regulatory
modernization opportunities to improve efficiencies, with no impact on the
security of travelers. This includes alignment with recent changes implemented
by the United States, and the introduction of other labour-saving best practices
to modernize service delivery.
Embracing innovation will also drive efficiencies and strengthen national
security. This will include deploying automated systems to detect prohibited
items at pre-board screening checkpoints and enhance screening efficiency.
CATSA will further examine opportunities to integrate this technology into
screening processes with Transport Canada. Savings will materialize once these
technologies have been integrated within existing security infrastructure in
alignment with global best practices following extensive validation and testing.

328 ANNEX THREE
Treasury Board
The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) continues to play a vital
leadership role in managing government resources—including finance, human
resources, and information technology—while evolving to meet the needs of a
modern public service. To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three
years, TBS will refocus on its core business functions and modernize its
organizational structure and processes to enhance agility and efficiency.
To support this shift, TBS will reorient initiatives that have achieved their
intended goals or where opportunities exist to integrate efforts more
effectively. For example, having developed policy, guidance, centralized tools
and oversight mechanisms to support the Government of Canada’s Enterprise
Cyber Security Strategy, TBS will allow the related temporary funding to wind
down and reorient its role toward strategic coordination and support. TBS will
recalibrate its involvement in the Low Carbon Fuel Production Program, shifting
toward direct collaboration with organizations that are best positioned to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt low-carbon solutions.
TBS will also transform its internal operations by consolidating work units,
rightsizing management and administrative support, and Modernising key
processes. This includes enhancing leadership development and talent
management programs, and leveraging automation to drive consistency,
scalability, and service excellence across the organization.

Veterans Affairs
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, Veterans Affairs
Canada (VAC) is implementing program changes while protecting client-facing
services. The government is committed to ensuring Veterans receive the timely,
compassionate support they need, as demonstrated through the financial
commitment in Budget 2025 for stabilising the processing capacity for disability
benefits applications and modernising IT infrastructure.
Similar to the RCMP, VAC will adjust how it delivers the Cannabis for Medical
Purposes benefit. Currently, the program reimburses medical cannabis at a rate
of $8.50 per gram, which is significantly above the market price. VAC will
transition to reimburse at $6.00 per gram – which still remains above, but closer
to the market price. This adjustment maintains existing entitlements to meet the
needs of Veterans, while ensuring the government is paying a fair price to
provide this support. For those Veterans who already purchase medical cannabis
for $6.00 per gram or less, they will see no change. Savings represent an
actuarial accounting adjustment of employee future benefits. Savings on a cash
basis will be gradual, being realized over time as benefit payments are issued at
a lower rate compared to the current status quo.

Modernising Operations at the Regional
Development Agencies
To meet up to 15 per cent in savings targets over three years, the Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs) will recalibrate their programming suite to focus
on their mandate to promote long-term economic development. The agencies
will reprioritize their respective Regional Economic Growth through Innovation
programs towards support that strengthens their regions’ economic
development, focusing on investments that drive economic growth. The RDAs
will also wind down the Tourism Growth Program after 2025-26, with the
industry continuing to be supported by regular programming.
The RDAs will also modernise their operations and internal services to reflect
their program funding going forward and will implement targeted process
improvements by optimizing their workflows and reducing duplication by
integrating new technologies. Through digital transformation and integrating AI,
as well as simplifying processes, the RDAs will increase their efficiency and
minimize the impact of the reductions on client services.

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 337
Personal Income Tax Measures
Personal Support Workers Tax Credit
Budget 2025 proposes to introduce a temporary Personal Support Workers Tax
Credit, which would provide eligible personal support workers working for eligible
health care establishments with a refundable tax credit of 5 per cent of eligible
earnings, providing a credit value of up to $1,100.
Eligible Personal Support Worker
A number of conditions would need to be met to be considered an eligible personal
support worker. The person must ordinarily provide one-on-one care and essential
support to optimise and maintain another individual’s health, well-being, safety,
autonomy, and comfort, consistent with that individual’s health care needs as
directed by a regulated health care professional or a provincial community health
organization. The person’s main employment duties must include helping patients
with activities of daily living and mobilization.
Eligible Health Care Establishment
Eligible health care establishments would be hospitals, nursing care facilities,
residential care facilities, community care facilities for the elderly, home health care
establishments, and other similar regulated health care establishments.
Eligible Earnings
Eligible earnings would include all taxable employment income, including wages and
salaries, and employment benefits (as well as similar tax-exempt income and
benefits earned on a reserve) that is earned as an eligible personal support worker
performing employment duties for eligible health care establishments.
Amounts earned in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, and the
Northwest Territories would not be eligible, as these jurisdictions have signed
bilateral agreements with the federal government to include a “Personal Support
Workers and Related Professions Addendum” to their Aging with Dignity funding
agreements, which provide funding over five years to increase personal support
workers’ wages.
Employers would need to certify their employees’ eligible earnings in prescribed
form and manner.
-- 347 of 493 --

338
Other
Individuals would need to file a tax return to be eligible for this refundable tax
credit. If an eligible individual dies during a calendar year, any tax return filed by the
individual’s legal representative would be deemed to have been filed by the
individual.
Where an eligible individual becomes bankrupt in a taxation year, that individual’s
eligible earnings from both the pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy period would
be taken into consideration when computing this tax credit.
Coming into Force
This measure would apply to the 2026 to 2030 taxation years.
Automatic Federal Benefits for Lower-Income Individuals
Canada’s tax system is based on self-assessment and self-reporting. The Income Tax
Act requires individuals with tax payable to file a tax return. In general, individuals
also need to file a tax return annually to receive the benefit and credit payments
delivered through the tax system, because the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
determines entitlement for most benefits on net income.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to grant the CRA the
discretionary authority to file a tax return for a taxation year on behalf of an
individual (other than a trust) who meets all the following criteria:
• 	the individual’s taxable income for the taxation year is below the lower of either
the federal basic personal amount or provincial equivalent (plus the age amount
and/or disability amount, where applicable);
• 	all income of the individual for the taxation year is from sources for which
specified information returns have been filed with the CRA;
• 	at least once in the preceding three taxation years, the individual has not filed a
return;
• 	the individual has otherwise not filed a return for the taxation year prior to,
or within 90 days following, the tax filing deadline for the year; and
• 	any other criteria, as determined by the Minister of National Revenue.
Prior to filing a return on behalf of an eligible individual, the CRA would provide the
individual with the information it has available at the time in respect of their tax
return. The eligible individual would have 90 days to review the information and
submit changes to the CRA. If the eligible individual does not confirm the
-- 348 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 339
information (with or without changes) by the end of the 90 days, the CRA could file
a tax return on the individual’s behalf. The CRA would then issue a notice of
assessment, and subsequently determine and issue the individual’s credit and
benefit entitlements.
Certain basic information, such as marital status, may require confirmation from the
individual before the CRA can issue a payment of benefits. Some entitlements
require a return to be filed by the individual’s spouse or common-law partner. The
CRA may be able to file a return on behalf of the individual’s spouse if it is
determined that they meet the criteria.
The existing assessment, objection, and appeal processes would apply to
assessments issued under these provisions. If it is determined after a tax return has
been filed by the CRA that the taxpayer did not meet the requirements for
automatic tax filing, the tax return will be deemed not to have been filed.
Individuals would be able to opt out of automatic tax filing.
This measure would apply to the 2025 and subsequent taxation years (i.e., filing
could begin in 2026).
Consultation
The government is seeking Canadians' views on this measure. Interested parties are
invited to send written representations to the Department of Finance Canada at
autotaxfiling-autoimpot@fin.gc.ca by January 30, 2026.
Top-Up Tax Credit
The rate applied to most non-refundable tax credits is based on the first marginal
personal income tax rate. The middle-class tax cut announced in May 2025, and
included in Bill C-4, currently before Parliament, would reduce the first marginal
personal income tax rate, and thus the rate applied to most non-refundable tax
credits, from 15 per cent to 14.5 per cent for the 2025 taxation year, and to 14 per
cent for the 2026 and subsequent taxation years.
In very rare cases where an individual’s non-refundable tax credit amounts exceed
the first income tax bracket threshold ($57,375 in 2025), the decrease in the value
of these credits may exceed their tax savings from the rate reduction. This could
happen in circumstances where an individual claims a large one-time expense, such
as amounts for high tuition or medical expenses, or claims a combination of large
tax credits. In some cases, these claims are for both themselves and a dependant, or
include amounts carried forward from previous years.
-- 349 of 493 --

340
To ensure that no one in this circumstance has their tax liability increased by the
middle-class tax cut, and to help Canadians transition to the lower credit rate,
Budget 2025 proposes to introduce a new non-refundable Top-Up Tax Credit. The
credit would effectively maintain the current 15-per-cent rate for non-refundable
tax credits claimed on amounts in excess of the first income tax bracket threshold.
The Top-Up Tax Credit would apply for the 2025 to 2030 taxation
years.
Qualified Investments for Registered Plans
Budget 2024 invited stakeholders to provide suggestions on improving the clarity
and coherence of the qualified investments regime for seven types of registered
plans: Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Registered Retirement Income
Funds (RRIFs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), Registered Education Savings
Plans (RESPs), Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs), First Home Savings
Accounts (FHSAs), and Deferred Profit Sharing Plans (DPSPs). The qualified
investment regime governs what these plans can invest in. A broad range of assets
are qualified investments, including mutual funds, publicly traded securities,
government and corporate bonds, and guaranteed investment certificates.
Based on feedback received through the consultation process, Budget 2025
proposes the following amendments to simplify, streamline, and harmonise the
qualified investment rules.
Small Business Investments
There are two sets of rules for registered plan investments in small businesses. The
first set of rules applies to RRSPs, RRIFs, TFSAs, RESPs, and FHSAs, while the
second set of rules applies only to RRSPs, RRIFs, RESPs, and DPSPs. Neither set of
rules applies to RDSPs. The first set of rules provides for investments in what are
known as specified small business corporations, venture capital corporations, and
specified cooperative corporations. The second set of rules provides for
investments in eligible corporations, small business investment limited partnerships,
and small business investment trusts.
Each category of investments contains a number of specific rules and restrictions,
which must be met in order to qualify. There is duplication and complexity within
these rules, which leads to uncertainty as to which rules are meant to apply in a
particular case and has led to some investment categories being underutilised. As
examples, the eligible corporation rules have significant overlap with the specified
-- 350 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 341
small business corporation rules and, in 2024, there were no small business
investment trusts reported in Canada.
Budget 2025 proposes to simplify and streamline the rules relating to registered
plan investments in small businesses, while maintaining the ability of registered
plans to make such investments. In particular, the more broadly applicable first set
of rules would be maintained and extended to RDSPs, while the second set of rules
would be repealed. As a result,
• 	RDSPs would be permitted to acquire shares of specified small business
corporations, venture capital corporations, and specified cooperative
corporations; and
• 	Shares of eligible corporations and interests in small business investment limited
partnerships and small business investment trusts would no longer be qualified
investments.
These amendments would apply as of January 1, 2027. Interests in small business
investment limited partnerships and small business investment trusts that are
acquired before 2027 under the current rules would continue to be qualified
investments. It is intended that shares of eligible corporations would continue to be
qualified investments under the rules relating to specified small business
corporations that would be maintained.
Registered Investment Regime
Registered investments are qualified investments for all registered plans. For a
corporation or a trust to be a registered investment, it must be registered with the
Canada Revenue Agency.
Units of a mutual fund trust are qualified investments, but the mutual fund trust
can also be a registered investment. In order for a trust or corporation that is not
sufficiently widely held (e.g., a trust that does not have the 150 unitholders
required to qualify as a mutual fund trust) to qualify as a registered investment, the
trust or corporation must hold only investments that would be qualified
investments for the types of registered plans for which it is registered. Otherwise,
the trust or corporation would be liable to pay a monthly tax of up to one per cent
of the acquisition-date fair market value of the non-qualified investment.
Stakeholders have suggested that the registration process does not add sufficient
value to justify its associated compliance and administration burdens.
Budget 2025 proposes to replace the registered investment regime with two new
categories of qualified investments which do not involve registration:
-- 351 of 493 --

342
• 	Units of a trust that is subject to the requirements of National Instrument 81–
102 published by the Canadian Securities Administrators (which regulates
certain mutual funds and non-redeemable investment funds); and
• 	Units of a trust that is an investment fund (as defined in existing tax rules)
managed by a registered investment fund manager as described in National
Instrument 31–103 published by the Canadian Securities Administrators.
It is generally expected that units or shares of funds that were registered
investments would continue to qualify, either under existing rules or under one or
both of the new categories of qualified investment trusts.
The registered investment regime would be repealed as of January 1, 2027. The
new qualified investment trust rules would apply as of Budget Day.
Other Changes
Budget 2025 also proposes to make a number of other technical legislative
amendments to simplify the qualified investment rules. Notably, the qualified
investment rules for six types of registered plans (i.e., all plans except DPSPs) would
be consolidated into one definition in the Income Tax Act.
In addition, the list of qualified investments prescribed in the Income Tax Regulations
would be updated and reorganised by asset class (e.g., debt instruments or equity
instruments). These changes are intended to make the rules simpler and clearer.
Information Sharing – Worker Misclassification
Budget 2024 announced that Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC)
and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) would enter into data-sharing agreements
to facilitate inspections and enforcement to address worker misclassification. The
misclassification of employees as independent contractors is of particular concern
in the trucking industry. ESDC recently began sharing information with the CRA,
but information-sharing restrictions in the tax rules prevent the CRA from sharing
the required information with ESDC.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the information sharing provisions of the Income
Tax Act and the Excise Tax Act to allow the CRA to share taxpayer information
(under the Income Tax Act) and confidential information (under the Excise Tax Act)
with ESDC for the purposes of the administration and enforcement of the Canada
Labour Code as it relates to the classification of workers.
This measure would come into force on royal assent of the enacting legislation.

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 343
Home Accessibility Tax Credit
The Home Accessibility Tax Credit is a non-refundable tax credit that applies at the
lowest personal income tax rate on up to $20,000 of eligible home renovation or
alteration expenses per calendar year. Expenses must be incurred to improve the
safety, accessibility, or functionality of an eligible dwelling of a qualifying individual
who is aged 65 or older or eligible for the Disability Tax Credit.
The Medical Expense Tax Credit is a non-refundable tax credit that applies at the
lowest personal income tax rate on the amount of qualifying medical and disability-
related expenses in excess of the lesser of $2,834 (for 2025) and 3 per cent of the
claimant’s net income. Medical Expense Tax Credit-eligible expenses include certain
costs to build or renovate a home to improve access or mobility for persons with
disabilities.
At present, if the eligibility criteria for both credits are met, taxpayers can claim
both credits in respect of the same expense.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act such that an expense claimed
under the Medical Expense Tax Credit cannot also be claimed under the Home
Accessibility Tax Credit.
This measure would apply to the 2026 and subsequent taxation years.
21-Year Rule
Personal trusts are generally deemed to have disposed of their capital property and
certain other property for fair market value proceeds on the 21st anniversary of
their creation, and every 21st anniversary thereafter (the “21-year rule”). This
prevents personal trusts from being used to indefinitely postpone tax on accrued
gains.
Where property is transferred by a trust on a tax-deferred basis to a new trust, a
rule prevents the avoidance of the 21-year rule. In that case, the new trust
essentially inherits the earlier 21-year anniversary of the old trust. This ensures that
the transferred property remains subject to the same 21-year period that applied to
the old trust.
Certain tax avoidance planning techniques have been employed to transfer trust
property indirectly to a new trust to avoid both the 21-year rule and the anti-
avoidance rule. For example, this planning may involve trust property being
-- 353 of 493 --

344
transferred on a tax-deferred basis to a beneficiary that is a corporation owned by a
new trust. This planning seeks to do indirectly what cannot be done directly.
Budget 2025 proposes to broaden the current anti-avoidance rule for direct trust-
to-trust transfers to include indirect transfers of trust property to other trusts.
This measure would apply in respect of transfers of property that occur on or after
Budget Day.
Canada Carbon Rebate
The Canada Carbon Rebate (CCR) is the main mechanism for returning proceeds
from the federal fuel charge directly to Canadians residing in provinces where the
charge applied, provided they meet eligibility requirements (including filing a tax
return).
With the removal of the federal fuel charge as of April 1, 2025, the government
provided a final quarterly CCR payment starting in April 2025 to eligible
households.
To support the winding down of mechanisms to return fuel charge proceeds,
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that no CCR
payments would be made in respect of tax returns, or adjustment requests, filed
after October 30, 2026.
Business Income Tax Measures
Immediate Expensing for Manufacturing and Processing
Buildings
The capital cost allowance (CCA) system determines the deductions that a business
may claim each year for income tax purposes in respect of the capital cost of its
depreciable property. Depreciable property is generally divided into CCA classes
with each having its own rate in the Income Tax Regulations. These rates generally
align with the expected useful life of the assets in their classes.
Currently, eligible buildings in Canada used to manufacture or process goods for
sale or lease (manufacturing or processing buildings) are prescribed a CCA rate of
ten per cent. This includes the regular CCA rate of four per cent under Class 1, plus
an additional allowance of six per cent for manufacturing or processing buildings.
To be eligible for the six-per-cent additional allowance, at least 90 per cent of the
-- 354 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 345
building’s floor space must be used to manufacture or process goods for sale or
lease.
Budget 2025 proposes to provide temporary immediate expensing for the cost of
eligible manufacturing or processing buildings, including the cost of eligible
additions or alterations made to such buildings. The enhanced allowance would
provide a 100-per-cent deduction in the first taxation year that eligible property is
used for manufacturing or processing, provided the minimum 90-per-cent floor
space requirement is met.
Property that has been used, or acquired for use, for any purpose before it is
acquired by the taxpayer would be eligible for immediate expensing only if both of
the following conditions are met:
• 	neither the taxpayer nor a non-arm’s-length person previously owned the
property; and
• 	the property has not been transferred to the taxpayer on a tax-deferred
“rollover” basis.
In cases where a taxpayer benefits from immediate expensing of a manufacturing
or processing building, and the use of the building is subsequently changed,
recapture rules may apply.
This measure would be effective for eligible property that is acquired on or after
Budget Day and is first used for manufacturing or processing before 2030. An
enhanced first-year CCA rate of 75 per cent would be provided for eligible property
that is first used for manufacturing or processing in 2030 or 2031, and a rate of
55 per cent would be provided for eligible property that is first used for
manufacturing or processing in 2032 or 2033. The enhanced rate would not be
available for property that is first used for manufacturing or processing after 2033.
Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax
Incentive Program
Under the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) tax
incentive program, qualifying expenditures are fully deductible in the year they
are incurred. Additionally, these expenditures are generally eligible for an
investment tax credit.
The tax credit is provided at two rates:
• 	A fully refundable tax credit at an enhanced rate of 35 per cent is available for
-- 355 of 493 --

346
Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs) on up to $3 million of
qualified SR&ED expenditures annually. The $3 million expenditure limit is
gradually phased out where a CCPC’s taxable capital employed in Canada for
the previous taxation year is between $10 million and $50 million. This limit is
shared within an associated group.
• 	A non-refundable tax credit at the general rate of 15 per cent is available for
corporations other than CCPCs and for qualified SR&ED expenditures of CCPCs
that do not qualify for the enhanced credit.
The 2024 Fall Economic Statement proposed a number of changes to the SR&ED
program that would:
• 	increase the expenditure limit from $3 million to $4.5 million and increase the
lower and upper prior-year taxable capital phase-out boundaries to $15 million
and $75 million, respectively;
• 	extend eligibility for the enhanced tax credit to eligible Canadian public
corporations; and
• 	restore the eligibility of SR&ED capital expenditures for both the deduction
against income and investment tax credit components of the SR&ED program.
The government confirms its intention to introduce legislation to implement these
measures.
Enhanced Credit Expenditure Limit
Budget 2025 proposes to further increase the expenditure limit on which the
SR&ED program’s enhanced 35-per-cent tax credit can be earned, from the
previously announced $4.5 million to $6 million.
This measure would apply for taxation years that begin on or after December 16,
2024 (i.e., the date of the 2024 Fall Economic Statement).
Agricultural Cooperatives: Patronage Dividends Paid in
Shares
Prior to 2005, patronage dividends paid in shares by an agricultural cooperative to
its members were taxable to the members in the year the shares were received.
The cooperative paying the dividend was also required to withhold an amount from
the dividend and remit it to the Canada Revenue Agency on account of the
recipient’s tax liability.
In 2005, the tax rules were amended to allow for the temporary deferral of income
taxes and withholding obligations on patronage dividends received as eligible
-- 356 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 347
shares until the disposition (including a deemed disposition) of the shares. An
eligible share must not, except in the case of death, disability or ceasing to be a
member, be redeemable or retractable within five years of its issue. The current
measure is set to expire at the end of 2025.
Budget 2025 proposes to extend this measure to apply in respect of eligible shares
issued before the end of 2030.
Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit
Flow-through shares allow corporations to renounce or "flow through" Canadian
exploration expenses (CEE), including Canadian renewable and conservation
expenses (CRCE), and Canadian development expenses (CDE) to investors, who can
deduct the expenses in calculating their own taxable income (at a 100-per-cent rate
for CEE, including for CRCE, and at a 30-per-cent rate on a declining-balance basis
for CDE).
The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) provides an additional income
tax benefit for individuals who invest in eligible flow-through shares. The CMETC is
equal to 30 per cent of specified mineral exploration expenses incurred in Canada
and renounced to flow-through share investors. The following critical minerals are
currently eligible for the CMETC: nickel, cobalt, graphite, copper, rare earth
elements, vanadium, tellurium, gallium, scandium, titanium, magnesium, zinc,
platinum group metals, uranium, and lithium (including lithium from brines).
Budget 2025 proposes to expand the eligibility of the CMETC to include the
following additional critical minerals: bismuth, cesium, chromium, fluorspar,
germanium, indium, manganese, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, tin, and tungsten.
This measure would apply to expenditures renounced under eligible flow-through
share agreements entered into after Budget Day and on or before March 31, 2027.
Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit
The Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit is a refundable tax
credit equal to 30 per cent of the cost of investments in new machinery and
equipment used to manufacture or process key clean technologies, or to extract,
process, or recycle critical minerals essential for clean technology supply chains (i.e.,
lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, copper, and rare earth elements).
-- 357 of 493 --

348
Budget 2025 proposes to expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the Clean
Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit to include antimony, indium,
gallium, germanium, and scandium.
This measure would apply in respect of property that is acquired and becomes
available for use on or after Budget Day.
Investment Tax Credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and
Storage
The Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) investment tax credit is a
refundable tax credit that provides support for eligible expenditures relating to
CCUS.
The CCUS tax credit provides three different credit rates depending on the purpose
of the equipment, with the following credit rates applying to eligible CCUS
expenditures incurred from the start of 2022 to the end of 2030:
• 	60 per cent for eligible capture equipment used in a direct air capture project;
• 	50 per cent for all other eligible capture equipment; and
• 	37.5 per cent for eligible transportation, storage and use equipment.
Eligible expenditures that are incurred from the start of 2031 to the end of 2040
are subject to the lower credit rates set out below:
• 	30 per cent for eligible capture equipment used in a direct air capture project;
• 	25 per cent for all other eligible capture equipment; and
• 	18.75 per cent for eligible transportation, storage and use equipment.
The extent to which the CCUS tax credit is available to a CCUS project and
respective eligible equipment depends on the end use of the carbon dioxide
(CO2) being captured. Eligible uses include dedicated geological storage and storage
in concrete, but not enhanced oil recovery (EOR).
Extension of Full Tax Credit Rates
Budget 2025 proposes to extend the availability of the full credit rates by five
years, so that the full rates apply to eligible expenditures incurred from the start of
2022 to the end of 2035. Eligible expenditures that are incurred from the start
of 2036 to the end of 2040 would continue to be subject to the lower credit rates
described above.
-- 358 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 349
The government will also postpone by five years the review of the CCUS
investment tax credit rates that was announced in Budget 2022. Under this new
timeline, the review will be undertaken before 2035 (rather than before 2030).
Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit and Canada Growth
Fund
The Clean Electricity investment tax credit is a refundable credit equal to 15 per
cent of the capital cost of eligible investments in equipment related to low-emitting
electricity generation, electricity storage, and the transmission of electricity
between provinces and territories.
This tax credit would be available to taxable Canadian corporations, provincial and
territorial Crown corporations, corporations owned by municipalities or Indigenous
communities, pension investment corporations, and the Canada Infrastructure
Bank. The capital cost of property that is eligible for the Clean Electricity
investment tax credit may be reduced by government assistance that a taxpayer
receives.
Budget 2025 proposes to include the Canada Growth Fund as an eligible entity
under the Clean Electricity investment tax credit.
Budget 2025 also proposes to introduce an exception so that financing provided by
the Canada Growth Fund would not reduce the cost of eligible property for the
purpose of computing the Clean Electricity investment tax credit.
These measures would apply to eligible property that is acquired and that becomes
available for use on or after Budget Day.
Tax Deferral Through Tiered Corporate Structures
The Income Tax Act includes a set of rules that seek to prevent the use of Canadian-
controlled private corporations (CCPC) to defer personal income tax on investment
income. Investment income earned by a CCPC is subject to an additional refundable
tax that increases the corporation’s tax rate to approximate the highest marginal
combined federal-provincial personal income tax rate. A corporation is entitled to a
refund of a portion of this additional tax when it pays a taxable dividend. The
refund reflects the fact that a shareholder who is an individual is subject to personal
income tax on a taxable dividend.
Unlike an individual shareholder, a corporate shareholder is generally not subject to
income tax on a taxable dividend received from another corporation because it can
-- 359 of 493 --

350
claim an offsetting inter-corporate dividend deduction. However, additional anti-
deferral rules in Part IV of the Income Tax Act may impose a special refundable tax
on the recipient corporation when it receives the taxable dividend. In particular, if
the recipient corporation receives a taxable dividend from a “connected
corporation” (generally, a corporation that owns shares carrying more than 10 per
cent of the votes and value of the payer corporation), a refundable tax is levied on
the recipient corporation corresponding to the amount of the payer corporation’s
dividend refund.
Part IV tax is payable by the recipient corporation on the balance-due day for its
taxation year in which the dividend is received. This day can be after the balance-
due day for the payer corporation’s taxation year in which the dividend was paid.
Certain tax planning techniques have been employed to take advantage of this
timing difference to defer, at times indefinitely, the tax liability on investment
income by interposing corporations with staggered year ends in a corporate chain.
For example, a corporation may pay a taxable dividend at a time that is in the payer
corporation’s 2025 taxation year and in the recipient corporation’s 2026 taxation
year, in order to defer the tax liability on the investment income of the corporate
group to the recipient’s balance-due day for its 2026 taxation year (rather than
being payable on the payer corporation’s balance-due day for 2025).
Budget 2025 proposes to limit the deferral of tax on investment income using
tiered corporate structures with mismatched year ends. In general terms, the
proposed limitation would suspend the dividend refund that could be claimed by a
payer corporation on the payment of a taxable dividend to an affiliated recipient
corporation if the recipient corporation’s balance-due day for the taxation year in
which the dividend was received ends after the payer corporation’s balance-due
day for the taxation year in which the dividend was paid. The determination of
whether the dividend payer and payee are affiliated would be based on current
affiliation rules in the Income Tax Act.
This rule would not apply if each corporate dividend recipient in the chain of
affiliated corporations pays a subsequent dividend on or before the payer’s
balance-due day, such that no deferral is achieved by the affiliated corporate group.
To accommodate bona fide commercial transactions, the rule would also not apply
to a dividend payer that is subject to an acquisition of control where it pays a
dividend within 30 days before the acquisition of control.
The payer corporation would generally be entitled to claim the suspended dividend
refund in a subsequent taxation year when the recipient corporation pays a taxable
dividend to a non-affiliated corporation or an individual shareholder.
-- 360 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 351
This measure would apply to taxation years that begin on or after Budget Day.
Eligible activities under the Canadian Exploration Expense
Canadian exploration expenses (CEE) may include expenses incurred by a taxpayer
for the purpose of determining the existence, location, extent, or quality of a
mineral resource in Canada.
CEE is a category of tax deduction that can be transferred from mining corporations
via flow-through shares to equity investors, who can then claim a 100-per-cent
immediate deduction on account of CEE. Further, individuals (other than trusts)
who invest in these flow-through shares may be able to claim the Mineral
Exploration Tax Credit or the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit in respect of
certain types of CEE.
The determination of a mineral resource’s “quality” for CEE purposes has
historically been interpreted by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to relate to the
resource’s underlying physical characteristics. Expenses for technical studies (which
are typically undertaken to assess a mineral resource’s engineering feasibility and
economic viability as a mining project, rather than its underlying physical
characteristics) have generally been viewed by the CRA as being excluded from
CEE.
A recent decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia held that the reference
to “quality” under the provincial equivalent of the federal CEE definition could be
interpreted to include the economic viability, and not just the physical
characteristics, of a mineral resource.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to clarify that expenses
incurred for the purpose of determining the quality of a mineral resource in Canada
do not include expenses related to determining the economic viability or
engineering feasibility of the mineral resource.
This amendment would apply as of Budget Day.
International Tax Measures
Transfer Pricing
For tax purposes, transfer pricing rules are used to allocate profit among the
various entities of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group. The accepted
international standard is the arm's length principle set out in Article 9 (Associated
-- 361 of 493 --

352
Enterprises) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital and included in Canada’s
bilateral tax treaties. In addition, the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for
Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations (the “OECD Transfer Pricing
Guidelines”) present internationally agreed principles and provide guidelines for the
application of the arm’s length principle.
Recognising that MNE groups may establish conditions in their intra-group relations
that differ from those that would be established between independent enterprises,
and that such differences may result in distortions in the profits accrued by
associated enterprises, the arm's length principle requires that the profits accrued
by associated enterprises be in accord with the profits that would have accrued had
the conditions been those that would have been made between independent
enterprises.
Domestic transfer pricing rules are required to ensure that the income recognised
for Canadian tax purposes properly reflects the respective contributions of
taxpayers and participating non-arm's length persons in cross-border transactions.
Budget 2021 announced the government’s intention to consult on updating
Canada’s transfer pricing rules.
After consideration of stakeholder comments received during the consultation
period, Budget 2025 proposes to modernise Canada’s transfer pricing rules to
better align with the international consensus on the application of the arm’s length
principle. In addition, an interpretation rule would be added to ensure that Canada’s
transfer pricing rules are applied in a manner consistent with the analytic
framework set out by the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The new rules would provide more detail on how cross-border transactions
between non-arm’s length persons must be analysed. To assist this analysis, a new
transfer pricing adjustment application rule would apply if two conditions are met:
(i) there is a transaction or series of transactions between a taxpayer and a non-
resident person with whom the taxpayer does not deal at arm’s length; and (ii) the
transaction or series (once it has been analysed and determined) includes actual
conditions different from arm’s length conditions. The actual conditions are
determined not only by the contractual terms of the transaction or series, but also
by other “economically relevant characteristics”, including the conduct of the
participants.
The resulting comparability analysis is at the heart of the arm’s length principle. The
arm’s length principle requires the following determination: what conditions would
-- 362 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 353
have been included in respect of the transaction or series that has been analysed
and determined had the participants been dealing at arm’s length in comparable
circumstances, taking into account the options realistically available to them at the
time of entering into the transaction or series?
The Transfer Pricing Guidelines describe the different methods that can be used to
determine whether the conditions of an in-scope transaction or series are
consistent with the arm’s length principle. The new rules would provide that this
determination should be made through an analysis where the most appropriate
method is selected and applied in accordance with the Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
The new rules would also provide that a transaction or series will be considered to
include conditions that differ from arm’s length conditions where: (i) a condition
does not exist as an actual condition, but would have existed had the participants
to the in-scope transaction or series been dealing at arm’s length in comparable
circumstances; or (ii) the participants would not have entered into the transaction
or series, or would have entered into a different transaction or series, had they
been dealing at arm’s length in comparable circumstances.
The main factors required for a transfer pricing analysis would be set out in the new
definition of “economically relevant characteristics”. The new rules would require
any in-scope transaction or series to be analysed and determined with reference to
the economically relevant characteristics of the transaction or series. The
economically relevant characteristics are used at both steps of the comparability
analysis to establish: (i) the starting point for the object to be compared by
accurately analysing and determining the in-scope transaction or series; and (ii) the
hypothetical comparator.
The economically relevant characteristics of a transaction or series would be
defined to include five comparability factors: contractual terms, functional profile,
characteristics of the property or service, economic and market context, and
business strategies. The first two comparability factors require consideration of the
“actual conduct” of the parties to the transaction. This is intended to ensure that
the factual substance of the transaction or series must be considered (instead of
just its legal form). Formal conditions recognised in contracts are clarified and
supplemented by the analysis of the conduct of the participants and the other
economically relevant characteristics of the transaction or series.
In addition, a new definition of “arm’s length conditions” would require the
comparison to posit what the actual participants to the in-scope transaction or
series would have done if they had been dealing at arm’s length, and not what other
theoretical parties dealing at arm’s length might have done.
-- 363 of 493 --

354
A new transfer pricing adjustment rule would provide that where the conditions of
the transfer pricing application rule are met, then any amounts that would be
determined for the purpose of applying the provisions of the Income Tax Act in
respect of the taxpayer’s taxation year are to be adjusted to the quantum or nature
of the amounts that would have been determined if the arm’s length conditions in
respect of the transaction or series would have applied.
Existing transfer pricing rules allow for, where specific conditions are met, the
substitution of the in-scope transaction with the transaction that would have been
entered into by parties dealing at arm’s length under terms and conditions that
would have been made between them. These rules would be replaced by the
inclusion of a new definition of “arm’s length conditions” that would allow
adjustments to reflect the fact that, in some cases, had the participants been
dealing at arm’s length, they would have entered into a different transaction or
series or would not have entered into a transaction or series at all. In accordance
with the Transfer Pricing Guidelines, and consistent with the interpretation rule, an
in-scope transaction or series accurately analysed and determined should be
replaced with an alternative transaction or series, or no transaction or series at all,
only in exceptional circumstances.
In addition, the new rules would modify certain administrative measures. These are
intended to balance the need for the Canada Revenue Agency to have timely,
accurate, and relevant information to conduct transfer pricing risk assessments and
efficient audits, while not imposing excessive or unnecessary compliance burdens
on taxpayers. They include:
• 	providing relief for taxpayers through an increase in the threshold for the
transfer pricing penalty to apply from an assessment (from a $5 million transfer
pricing adjustment to a $10 million adjustment);
• 	clarifying the transfer pricing documentation requirements and also more
closely aligning them with the new definitions and the requirements to select
and apply the most appropriate method;
• 	providing for simplified documentation requirements when prescribed
conditions are met; and
• 	reducing the time to provide transfer pricing documentation from 3 months to
30 days (whereas the requirement for taxpayers and partnerships to make or
obtain the appropriate records or documentation by their documentation-due
date for any given year or period would remain unchanged).
This measure would apply to taxation years that begin after Budget Day.

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 355
Investment Income Derived from Assets Supporting
Canadian Insurance Risks
The Canadian tax system contains rules that protect the tax base by preventing
taxpayers from avoiding Canadian tax by shifting certain income to other
jurisdictions. For example, income earned by a controlled foreign affiliate of a
taxpayer resident in Canada may be treated as foreign accrual property income
(FAPI), which is taxable in the hands of the Canadian taxpayer on an accrual basis. A
specific rule in the FAPI regime is intended to prevent avoidance of Canadian tax by
shifting income from a business involving the insurance of Canadian risks (i.e., risks
in respect of persons resident in Canada, property situated in Canada, or businesses
carried on in Canada) into a foreign affiliate. Under that rule, the insurance business
income is included in computing the affiliate’s FAPI.
Core activities that are essential to an insurance business include the investment of
funds collected through insurance premiums, with the resulting investment income
helping to support claims arising on the occurrence of insured events. This is the
case whether the assets are held by an insurer directly, or indirectly through a
foreign affiliate of the insurer as part of their integrated insurance business. In fact,
invested assets indirectly held by a foreign affiliate that are held to back Canadian
risks are generally regarded as backing Canadian risks for actuarial and regulatory
reporting purposes. In contrast, some taxpayers have taken the position that the
specific FAPI rule does not apply to such investment income arising on such assets.
Budget 2025 proposes to clarify that investment income derived from assets held
by a foreign affiliate to back Canadian risks is included in FAPI regardless of which
entity holds those assets. Investment income derived from assets backing Canadian
risks encompasses both income from assets held to back such risks and assets
included in regulatory surplus that back such risks.
This measure would apply to taxation years that begin after Budget Day.
Sales and Excise Tax Measures
Underused Housing Tax
The Underused Housing Tax (UHT) took effect on January 1, 2022 and applies to
certain owners of vacant or underused residential property in Canada, generally
non-resident, non-Canadians. The UHT is imposed on an annual basis at a rate of
1 per cent on the value of the property.
-- 365 of 493 --

356
Budget 2025 proposes to eliminate the UHT as of the 2025 calendar year. As a
result, no UHT would be payable and no UHT returns would be required to be filed
in respect of the 2025 and subsequent calendar years.
All UHT requirements continue to apply in respect of the 2022 to 2024 calendar
years. Penalties and/or interest for failing to file a UHT return as and when
required, or for failing to pay UHT when it becomes due, will also continue to apply
in respect of the 2022 to 2024 calendar years.
Luxury Tax on Aircraft and Vessels
The federal government imposes a tax on subject vehicles and subject aircraft with
a value above $100,000 and subject vessels (e.g., boats) with a value above
$250,000. The luxury tax is equal to the lesser of 10 per cent of the total value of
the subject item and 20 per cent of the value above the relevant threshold. The tax
is generally imposed on sales, importations, leases, and certain improvements of
subject vehicles, subject aircraft, and subject vessels.
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Select Luxury Items Tax Act (SLITA) to end the
luxury tax on subject aircraft and subject vessels. All instances of the tax would
cease to be payable after Budget Day, including the tax on sales, the tax on
importations, and the tax on improvements.
Registered vendors in respect of these items would be required to file a final return
covering the reporting period that includes Budget Day. Registrations in respect of
subject aircraft and subject vessels under the SLITA would be maintained after
Budget Day, allowing registered vendors the opportunity to claim rebates for which
they are eligible (e.g., in the case of export). However, returns in respect of these
items would otherwise no longer need to be filed for subsequent reporting periods.
Finally, all registrations in respect of subject aircraft and subject vessels would be
automatically cancelled on February 1, 2028, after which time vendors would no
longer be able to claim rebates.
Carousel Fraud
In recent years, certain individuals and groups have been trying to take advantage
of the Canadian tax system by engaging in carousel fraud schemes to obtain
unwarranted tax benefits. These illegal schemes undermine the tax system and are
continuously evolving. Carousel fraud schemes exploit the general design of a
value-added tax system, such as the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax
(GST/HST), by using a series of real or fraudulent transactions where at least one
-- 366 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 357
person, often known as the “missing trader”, collects GST/HST in respect of a
supply of property or services but does not remit it to the government.
In the 2024 Fall Economic Statement, the government announced that it was
exploring options to combat carousel schemes.
Budget 2025 announces proposed changes to the Excise Tax Act (the “Act”) to help
prevent carousel fraud and improve the overall fairness of the Canadian tax system.
Specifically, the government is proposing to introduce a new reverse charge
mechanism (RCM) beginning with certain supplies in the telecommunications
sector.
The federal government invites individuals, stakeholders, organizations and
associations, Indigenous partners, and other interested parties to share their
feedback on these proposals by emailing Consultation-Legislation@fin.gc.ca by
January 12, 2026. This will allow feedback to be taken into consideration prior to
finalizing the design of the new rules and the tabling of enacting legislation.
Proposed New Rules
Specified Supplies
The proposed new RCM would apply to supplies of specified telecommunication
services, which would be telecommunication services that enable:
• 	speech communication that is instant or with only a negligible delay between
the transmission and the receipt of signals; or
• 	the transmission of writing, images and sounds or information of any nature
when provided in connection with services that enable such speech
communication.
For example, this would include supplies of voice-over internet protocol (VoIP)
minutes.
Remittance Requirement (Reverse Charge Rules)
Under the proposed new rules, suppliers would not be required to collect the
GST/HST payable on the supply. Instead, when the RCM applies to a supply of
specified telecommunication services, recipients would be required to self-assess
and report the tax payable in their GST/HST return and, if entitled, would be
eligible to claim an input tax credit (ITC) in the same return provided that they
accounted for the GST/HST payable.
-- 367 of 493 --

358
Limited Application
The RCM would apply to supplies of specified telecommunication services provided
that the recipient is registered under Subdivision D of Division V of Part IX of the
Act and all or substantially all of the specified telecommunication services are
acquired by the recipient for the purpose of resupplying the specified
telecommunication services.
Input Tax Credit Eligibility
Under existing GST/HST rules, a person who is registered, or who is required to be
registered, may claim ITCs for previous reporting periods in respect of property or
services acquired or imported for consumption, use or supply in the course of a
commercial activity. The ability to claim ITCs for supplies subject to the RCM (or
that would have been subject to the RCM if the person was registered), however,
would be limited to persons that are registered at the time the tax becomes payable
or is paid without having become payable in respect of the supply.
Rebate Eligibility
Under existing GST/HST rules, persons that have paid an amount of tax (by mistake
or otherwise) that was not payable may be entitled to claim a rebate for tax paid in
error. Under the proposed new rules, however, a rebate for tax paid in error on a
supply subject to the RCM would be limited to cases where the person had paid the
amount to the Receiver General. Recipients who have erroneously paid the tax to a
supplier may request a refund of the tax paid directly from the supplier (e.g., by
means of a credit note) rather than from the government.
Invoice Requirements
Under the proposed new rules, suppliers would be required to indicate on their
invoices that a supply is subject to the RCM, signalling that the recipient should
therefore account for the GST/HST.
Regulations
The government will continue to monitor and assess the presence of carousel fraud
in Canada in order to determine whether other supplies should also be subject to
an RCM in the future. In this regard, the proposed new rules would include a new
legal authority that would allow the government to make other supplies subject to
an RCM by means of regulations.
GST/HST Treatment of Manual Osteopathic Services
Under the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST), services
covered under a provincial public health care plan are generally tax-exempt. In
-- 368 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 359
addition, most health care services rendered to individuals by physicians, dentists
and certain other health care practitioners set out in the GST/HST legislation are
also tax-exempt.
The list of GST/HST-exempt health care services currently includes an outdated
reference to osteopathic services. This was originally intended to cover services
rendered by osteopathic doctors, who have since been regulated as osteopathic
physicians and are now therefore covered by the general exemption for individuals
who practice the profession of medicine. The exemption was not intended to apply
to the services of manual osteopathic service providers who are not osteopathic
doctors. On June 6, 2025, New Brunswick passed legislation to become the first
province to establish a regulatory body to govern the profession of manual
osteopathy. As a result, osteopathic services supplied by qualifying manual
osteopathic service providers who are not osteopathic physicians have
unintentionally become tax-exempt under the GST/HST legislation.
Budget 2025 proposes to clarify the longstanding policy that osteopathic services
rendered by individuals who are not osteopathic physicians are taxable under the
GST/HST.
This measure would apply to supplies made after June 5, 2025, except that it would
not apply to a supply of osteopathic services made after June 5, 2025 but on or
before Budget Day if the supplier did not charge, collect or remit any amount as or
on account of tax in respect of the supply.
Strategic Environmental and Economic
Assessment Statement
In accordance with the Cabinet Directive on Strategic Environmental and Economic
Assessment, a strategic environmental assessment was conducted for the following
measures:
• 	Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit;
• 	Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit; and
• 	Investment Tax Credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage.
With respect to the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit measure, it was found
that mineral exploration, as well as new mining and related processing activities
that could follow from successful exploration efforts, can be associated with a
variety of environmental impacts to soil, water and air and, as a result, could have
an impact on the targets and actions in the Federal Sustainable Development
-- 369 of 493 --

360
Strategy. Potential nature and biodiversity effects could also arise, particularly from
mining activity that could subsequently follow from mineral exploration. All such
activities, however, are subject to applicable federal and provincial environmental
regulations, including project-specific environmental assessments where required.
Further, the measure supports exploration for certain critical minerals that may be
important in supporting the transition to a low carbon economy.
With respect to the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit
measure, mining activities can have direct negative impacts on local habitat such as
through increased soil erosion and mine runoff. All such activities, however, are
subject to applicable federal and provincial environmental regulations. If the
measure results in a greater adoption of clean technologies in Canada then it could
have positive impacts towards achieving several of Canada’s sustainable
development goals.
The Investment Tax Credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage measure is
expected to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the 2030 to 2050
timeframe and as such contribute to Canada’s goal of achieving net zero by 2050.
In accordance with the Cabinet Directive on Strategic Environmental and Economic
Assessment, a strategic economic assessment was conducted for the following
measures:
• 	Personal Support Workers Tax Credit;
• 	Immediate Expensing for Manufacturing or Processing Buildings;
• 	Investment Tax Credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage;
• 	Tax Deferral Through Tiered Corporate Structures; and
• 	Transfer Pricing.
With respect to the Personal Support Workers Tax Credit measure, it was found
that it would have a short-term impact on the healthcare sector and could lead to
positive but modest impacts in terms of real GDP and consumption.
With respect to the Immediate Expensing for Manufacturing or Processing
Buildings measure, it was found that the measure would have a positive economic
impact on the manufacturing or processing sector. Positive impacts on GDP are
expected from increased business investment in response to this measure.
With respect to the Investment Tax Credit for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and
Storage measure, it was found that the measure would have a positive economic
-- 370 of 493 --

TAX MEASURES: SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 361
impact at the national level (though impacts would be regionally concentrated),
partly due to the incremental capital investments supported by the measure.
With respect to the Tax Deferral Through Tiered Corporate Structures and Transfer
Pricing measures, it was found that they would support the integrity of the tax
system and would positively contribute to fiscal sustainability.

DEBT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 1
Annex 4
Debt Management Strategy
Introduction
The 2026-27 Debt Management Strategy sets out the Government of Canada's
objectives, strategy, and borrowing plans for its domestic and foreign debt program
and the management of its official international reserves.
The Financial Administration Act (FAA) requires that the Minister of Finance table, in
each House of Parliament, a report on the anticipated borrowing to be undertaken
in the fiscal year ahead, including the purposes for which the money will be
borrowed and the management of the public debt, no later than 30 sitting days
after the beginning of the fiscal year.
The Debt Management Strategy is usually included with the Budget as it permits an
assessment of the Government of Canada’s borrowing needs alongside contextual
information included in Annex 1, such as overall financial requirements. Following
the government’s decision to move to a fall budgeting cycle, starting with Budget
2025, this Debt Management Strategy includes a preliminary borrowing plan for
2026-27, with an update to be provided in advance of the 2026-27 fiscal year.
The update will allow for the inclusion of any adjustments to the fiscal or economic
environment ahead of the implementation of the 2026-27 Debt Management
Strategy.
This Debt Management Strategy also includes an update to the 2025-26 Debt
Management Strategy released in July 2025. Overall, the borrowing program is
projected to be slightly lower for the remainder of fiscal year 2025-26 resulting in a
downward revision to treasury bill issuance.
Objectives
The fundamental objectives of debt management are to raise stable and low-cost
funding to meet the financial requirements of the Government of Canada and to
maintain a well-functioning market for Government of Canada securities.
The government is committed to managing the debt program in a prudent manner
to ensure a balanced debt structure that contributes to maintaining the stability of
debt costs and to reducing the risk of the debt portfolio.
-- 419 of 493 --

2 ANNEX 4
Having access to a well-functioning government securities market contributes to
lower costs and less volatile pricing for the government, ensuring that funds can be
raised efficiently over time to meet the government's financial requirements.
The Debt Management Strategy provides transparency on the government's
borrowing plans to support a liquid and well-functioning market for Government of
Canada securities and ensures the long-term sustainability of the government's
borrowing program.
The government closely monitors financial markets and will adjust issuance if
necessary to appropriately respond to shifts in market demand or changes to
financial requirements.
Outlook for Government of Canada Debt and
Public Debt Charges
As a result of the government’s responsible fiscal management, Canada continues
to have a desirable fiscal and debt position relative to international peers. Canada
continues to have the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio of G7 countries. Rating
agencies cite Canada's effective and predictable policymaking, stable political
institutions, economic resilience and diversity, well-regulated financial markets, and
monetary and fiscal policy flexibility as drivers of the strong credit profile. Canada is
rated AAA (equivalent) by Moody’s, S&P, and DBRS, and AA+ by Fitch. The
government continues to monitor public debt charges and is committed to
maintaining stable and low debt servicing costs. The government now projects that
public debt charges will amount to $55.6 billion in 2025-26, or 1.8 per cent of gross
domestic product (GDP), and increase to 2.1 per cent by 2029-30.
Despite the rise of interest rates since 2022, the government’s debt charges as a
share of GDP remain sustainable, near historical lows, and below the historical
average over the past 40 years of 3.2 per cent. Maintaining low debt charges as a
percentage of GDP reflects the government’s prudent debt management in
minimising debt servicing costs over recent years.

Update to the 2025-26 Borrowing Plan
The 2025-26 Debt Management Strategy released in July 2025 included projected
financial requirements for measures announced between the Fall Economic
Statement and June 9, 2025.
Financial requirements for 2025-26 have declined slightly from what was projected
in the 2025-26 Debt Management Strategy released in July 2025. As a result,
treasury bill issuance will decline slightly. Should actual borrowing needs differ
between now and the end of the fiscal year, debt issuance will be adjusted initially
through changes in the issuance of treasury bills.
The bond program is not forecast to change for the remainder of 2025-26. The 30-
year benchmark range (see Table A4.4 below) is being adjusted to ensure that the
current benchmark building cycle is maintained.
2026-27 Borrowing Program
In 2026-27, borrowing needs are projected to remain in line with those of 2025-26.
The outlined objectives of raising stable low-cost funding and maintaining a well-
functioning market have led the government to retain the broad parameters of the
2025-26 borrowing program for 2026-27. To ensure that the market has timely
and updated information ahead of the 2026-27 fiscal year, an update will be
provided to account for any evolution of the economic or fiscal environment.

Highlights from the Consultations
In September 2025, the Department of Finance and the Bank of Canada held 30
meetings to hear the views of market participants. These consultations, which are
an integral part of the debt management process, specifically sought views on
issues related to the design and operation of the Government of Canada's domestic
debt program for 2026-27.
Overall, market participants viewed the Canadian bond market as functioning
effectively despite periodic volatility in global bond markets. Consistency and
predictability continued to be important priorities for bond market participants.
The current mix of tenors for issuance was broadly viewed as being appropriate
and well balanced. It was noted that elevated issuance from all levels of
government was leading to some challenges for Canadian dealers with respect to
balance sheet capacity.
In the treasury bill sector, market participants also expressed a general preference
to keep treasury bill issuance around $300 billon, and satisfaction with the issuance
size and mix of products.
Projected Borrowing Activities for 2026-27
The projected sources and uses of borrowings for 2025-26 and 2026-27 are
presented in Table A4.1. The comparison of actual sources and uses of borrowings
against projections will be reported in the Debt Management Report for the
corresponding fiscal year, which is released soon after the Public Accounts of Canada.
Sources of Borrowings
The aggregate principal amount of money to be borrowed by the government in
2026-27 is projected to be $594 billion, down from $614 billion in 2025-26.
Seventy-five per cent of the total borrowings will be used to refinance maturing
debt. This level of borrowing is consistent with the current legislated limit of
$2,126 billion set out in the Borrowing Authority Act.
Actual borrowings for the year may be higher or lower than expected due to
economic and fiscal outcomes differing from projections, the timing of cash
transactions, and other factors such as changes in foreign reserve needs and Crown
corporation borrowings. To adjust for these unexpected changes in financial
requirements, debt issuance can be altered during the year, typically first through
changes in the issuance of treasury bills. The government may also adjust issuance
for bonds in response to larger changes or shifts in market demand.

DEBT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 5
Uses of Borrowings
Domestic Borrowing
The projected 2026-27 gross issuance of domestic bonds and treasury bills (i.e.,
domestic borrowing program) totals $589 billion (see Table A4.2). This reflects
requirements to refinance $440 billion of maturing debt, in addition to projected
financial requirements of $149 billion, which includes $30 billion to fund purchases
of Canada Mortgage Bonds. The government’s financial requirements are subject to
economic conditions and other developments which may lead to revisions.
Foreign Borrowing
The government may also borrow an equivalent of $5 billion CAD in foreign
currencies, for the purpose of managing its official international reserves as part
of its global bond program (more details below).

Treasury Bill Program
The projected borrowing plan for 2026-27 anticipates a target stock of $291 billion
in treasury bills by March 31, 2027. The government considers that the 3-, 6- and
12-month tenors appropriately reflect the market demand for short-term
government issuance and will maintain its current bi-weekly auction schedule.
2026-27 Bond Program
Annual gross bond issuance is projected to be $298 billion in 2026-27, down from
$316 in 2025-26. Issuance has been decreased in the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year
sectors relative to 2025-26. Bond issuance is projected to comprise just over half
of total borrowing. Of the bond program, 35 per cent will be in tenors with
maturities of 10 or more years, up slightly from 34 per cent in 2025-26.
Maturity Date Cycles and Benchmark Bond Target
Size Ranges
The government will maintain the benchmark target size ranges and number of
planned auctions, with the exception of the 30-year benchmark which will be
adjusted to ensure the current benchmark building cycle is maintained (see Tables
A4.4 and A4.5).

Legislative Proposals to Support Building a New Canadian
Economy and Defending Canada
The Borrowing Authority Act specifies the maximum amount of borrowings that can
be undertaken by the Government of Canada and agent Crown corporations, as
well as Canada Mortgage Bonds that can be guaranteed by the Canada Mortgage
and Housing Corporation.
To support the growing investment in Canada’s economy and defence capabilities,
Budget 2025 proposes to amend the Borrowing Authority Act to increase the
maximum amount that can be borrowed from $2,126 billion to $2,541 billion.
Green Bond Program
In October 2025, the government completed its first transaction of 2025-26 via a
$2.5 billion dual tranche issuance which saw strong demand from green and socially
responsible investors and attracted a mix of Canadian and international investors.
$1 billion of a new 30-year green bond was issued, alongside a $1.5 billion re-
opening of the 7-year bond first issued in 2025.
-- 426 of 493 --

DEBT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY 9
Canada’s green bond program continues to support the growth of the sustainable
finance market in Canada and highlights Canada’s investments in climate action and
the environment. The government remains committed to regular green bond
issuances and will explore the development of a Sustainable Bond Framework that
would allow for the issuance of both green and transition bonds to be aligned with
Made-in-Canada Sustainable Investment Guidelines (“taxonomy”), and to expand the
Framework to incorporate economic sectors as the taxonomy is being developed.
Canada Mortgage Bonds
The Government of Canada, as part of its agenda to catalyse major investments in
housing and to build homes at a rate not seen since the Second World War, will
increase the Canada Mortgage Bonds (CMB) annual issuance limit from $60 billion
to $80 billion, starting in 2026. The increase in this cost-effective funding will solely
apply to multi-unit housing.
The government will maintain the current pace of its purchases of CMBs, up to
$30 billion annually, to allow the private market full access to the additional
issuance.
Management of Canada’s Official International Reserves
The Exchange Fund Account (EFA), managed by the Minister of Finance on behalf
of the Government of Canada, represents the largest component of Canada’s
official international reserves. It is a portfolio of Canada’s liquid foreign exchange
reserves and special drawing rights available to aid in the control and protection of
the external value of the Canadian dollar and as a source of liquidity to the
government, if needed. In addition to the EFA, Canada’s official international
reserves include Canada’s reserve position held at the International Monetary Fund.
The government borrows to invest in liquid reserves, which are maintained at a
level at or above 3 per cent of GDP. Foreign currency bond issuance for 2026-27
may be up to an equivalent of $5 billion CAD but may vary depending on market
conditions.
Canada's issuance of foreign currency denominated debt is used exclusively to fund
official international reserves. Global bonds denominated in US dollars or euros
have been issued 13 times since 2009 with the most recent one being in
March 2025.
-- 427 of 493 --

10 ANNEX 4
Further information on foreign currency funding and the foreign reserve assets is
available in the Report on the Management of Canada’s Official International Reserves
and in The Fiscal Monitor.
Bond Buyback Program
The government announced the resumption of the Government of Canada Cash
Management Bond Buyback program in November 2022. This treasury
management operation is intended to effectively manage the government's cash
flows ahead of large bond maturities.
The government plans to continue conducting cash management bond buybacks in
2026-27.
Cash Management
The core objective of cash management is to ensure that the government has
sufficient cash available at all times to meet its operating and liquidity
requirements.
As part of the prudent management of cash balances, the government reintroduced
morning Receiver General auctions on February 21, 2024.
Aside from cash deployed in the morning Receiver General auctions, the
government's cash is on deposit with the Bank of Canada, including operational
balances and balances held for prudential liquidity. Periodic updates on the liquidity
position are available in The Fiscal Monitor.
Prudential Liquidity
The government holds liquid financial assets in the form of domestic cash deposits
and foreign exchange reserves to safeguard its ability to meet payment obligations,
including coupon and principal payments, in situations where normal access to
funding markets may be disrupted or delayed. The government's overall liquidity
levels are managed to normally cover at least one month of projected net cash
flows, including coupon payments and debt refinancing needs.

RCMP members and for related benefits, effective
January 2027. These proposed legislative
amendments and/or regulations would also clarify
the escalation formula for the Disability Pension
Benefit and related benefits for CAF members,
veterans and serving and retired RCMP members
(including on a retroactive basis).

Amendments to the
International Development
Research Centre Act
In Budget 2025, the government proposes to
amend the International Development Research
Centre Act to update the requirements relevant to
quorum and Canadian citizenship. The amendments
would reduce the size of the Board of Governors
from 14 to 12 members and reduce governance
expenses through the reduction of honoraria, travel
and in-person Board meetings (holding more virtual
meetings). Reducing the number of Governors
would not have an adverse impact on the Board’s
oversight and would align its size with that of other
Crown corporations' boards.
Workforce Renewal 	In Budget 2025, the government proposes to
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act and
the Income Tax Regulations to offer an Early
Retirement Incentive Program through the Public
Service Pension Plan. Eligible public servants will be

Subject of the Measure 	Proposed Legislative Action
Government Efficiencies 	In the spirit of the 60-day regulatory review, the
government further intends to introduce a variety
of targeted amendments to legislation in order to
increase government efficiency and operational
effectiveness. This includes amendments that
would streamline low-risk internal
processes, modernise outdated requirements,
eliminate unnecessary and burdensome reporting
requirements, remove unnecessary barriers to agile
regulation-making, align legislative and regulatory
authorities across government and provide for the
delegation of certain matters where appropriate.
Results of this review will be available in
Budget 2026.
Strengthening the financial
sector transaction approval
process to include
additional considerations
In Budget 2025, the government proposes to

amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies
Act, and Trust and Loan Companies Act to repeal
provisions relating to certain technical limits found

flexible OSFI guidance, including limits on
borrowing and portfolio investments in commercial
loans, real property and equity.
Electronic delivery of
governance documents in
the financial institutions
statutes
In Budget 2025, the government proposes to
amend the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and
Trust and Loan Companies Act to include a “notice-
and-access” method of delivery of governance
documents, while retaining owners’ rights to
request delivery by mail.

amend the Bank Act to require that banks provide
public notice of branch closures on their websites;
to prohibit the charging of certain account
switching or closure fees from the time the bank
gives notice of its intent to close a branch until 12
months following their branch closure; and, to
require that banks that offer to open accounts to
individuals who are not physically present at a
branch have sufficient authentication processes to
verify digital versions of identification documents.
Enhancing the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial
Institutions’ authorities to
protect the financial sector
against integrity and
security risks

A Stronger Canada Through Diversity
Canada has made important progress in advancing equal opportunities for
women and other underrepresented groups, but vigilance and sustained efforts
are required to maintain the gains achieved. Embedding gender and diversity
considerations into decision-making is smart policy and helps improve outcomes
for Canadians. By ensuring that policies reflect the identities and values of
Canadians, we reinforce the unity that makes Canada strong, enabling everyone
to contribute to a resilient and sustainable future.
This budget is about building a new Canadian economy and an even stronger
Canada. It invests in growth and innovation, keeps life affordable for Canadians,
protects our sovereignty, and reflects the diversity of our people. By leveraging
Gender-based Analysis Plus, care was taken in developing this budget to better
understand how proposed measures could affect women and diverse groups,
and to take action where systemic barriers persist. The following measures in
particular will open up new opportunities and lead to fairer outcomes:
• 	Expanding home ownership opportunities for younger Canadians and
families through the Goods and Services Tax rebate for first-time home
buyers.
• 	Addressing housing pressures through Build Canada Homes will benefit
women, seniors, and those more likely to rent.
• 	Partnering with Indigenous Peoples at the Major Projects Office through
the Indigenous Advisory Council to ensure that Indigenous economic
participation is embedded in major projects advancements.
• 	Better integrating newcomers through faster recognition of foreign
credentials in health care and the skilled trades, which in turn help
improve services for Canadians.
• 	Increasing access to financial services, through consumer-driven banking,
particularly benefitting lower-income households.
-- 445 of 493 --

2 ANNEX 6
• 	Expanding economic opportunities and bolstering infrastructure for
Indigenous people, and rural and remote communities, through the Trade
Diversification Corridors Fund and Arctic Infrastructure Fund.
• 	Modernising the Canadian Armed Forces enhances opportunities for
youth to serve and lead.
• 	Keeping Canadian communities safe by enhancing the Canada Border
Services Agency and strengthening Federal Law Enforcement to combat
transnational criminal networks and other threats to Canada.
• 	Ensuring diverse Canadian voices are represented in our media
landscape, by boosting CBC/Radio-Canada funding.
Gender-Based Analysis Plus Summary of Budget 2025
Timing of GBA Plus
Budget 2025 shows continued
improvement in the timeliness
of GBA Plus, with 53 per cent
of budget measures supported
by GBA Plus at the early stage,
up from 39 per cent in the last
budget. This reflects steady
progress since 2019, when only
a limited number of measures
undertook early-stage analysis.
Relative to last budget, fewer
programs relied on existing
analyses for program
extensions or conducted GBA
Plus at the midpoint and later
stages. Better disaggregated data, stronger departmental capacity, and
sustained collaboration with Women and Gender Equality Canada (WAGE) have
embedded GBA Plus across the policy cycle, particularly the budget process.
This approach aligns with the Auditor General’s 2022 recommendations for
strengthening the application of GBA Plus.

GBA Plus Responsive Approaches
Chart A6.2
Responsive Approaches
A strength of Canada’s gender budgeting approach is its attention to identifying
barriers for women and other underrepresented groups, and integrating
mitigation actions into program design to address them. The barriers identified
for some Budget 2025 measures include access to participation, language,
disability, rural or remote geography, and the digital divide. In Budget 2025, in
all instances where measures identified a barrier, the measure also developed a
responsive approach to address it.
Advancing Gender Equality
The Gender Results Framework (GRF) enables the government to focus on what
drives progress toward gender equality. In Budget 2025, measures that are
expected to deliver measurable gender equality gains for women, gender-
diverse people, and other disadvantaged groups include Permanent Funding for
the Department for Women and Gender Equality announced on October 29,
2025 which helps advance the GRF goal on Gender-Based Violence and Access to
Justice. This funding will stabilise and renew work to improve women’s and girls’
economic security and leadership, strengthen federal action to address gender-
based violence for Indigenous and other underserved populations, and support
2SLGBTQI+ communities. This will help ensure that people facing intersecting
barriers, including Indigenous women and girls, women and girls with disabilities,
Black and other racialised women and girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people, can access
the supports they need.

How Is Canada Doing on Gender Equality?
Advancing gender equality is not just about creating a more equitable society.
An economy that provides equal opportunities is a prosperous economy
because it is able to make full use of its most valuable resource—the skills and
abilities of all its people. This is illustrated by the contribution to economic
growth in Canada attributable to increases in women’s workforce participation
in recent decades. Over the past 50 years, greater employment of women has
driven Canada’s real gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 13 per cent higher
today than it would have been otherwise, representing an increase in income of
$8,658 for each Canadian in 2024.
The Impact of Greater Women’s Employment in the Workforce
on Real GDP per Capita
Notes: Results include the impacts of both the increased women labour force participation rate and the reduced women
unemployment rate. The balance of the increase in real GDP per capita was the result of productivity improvements.
Sources: Statistics Canada; Department of Finance Canada calculations.
This highlights the potential for women and other underrepresented groups to
further strengthen their contributions to the Canadian economy and support
increased future prosperity in the face of demographic change, technological
advances and global trade realignment. At the same time, there remains a need
for ongoing monitoring of how diverse communities access educational
opportunities, engage in the economy and society, and experience risks such as
poverty and food insecurity.

Education and Skills Development
University at Bachelor’s Degree Level or Above (Highest Education),
25-54 Years (%)* **
Skills are the foundation of opportunity, and much of the advancement towards
gender equality in Canada can be traced to narrowing educational gaps between
women and men.
Substantial progress has been made since 2016 in increasing overall educational
attainment for women as well as for Indigenous people, newcomers and
persons with disabilities. While women are more likely than men to have
attained a bachelor’s degree or above, and have been since the early 2000s,
they remain less likely to enroll in the fields of science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM). However, over the past decade the share of women
enrolled in STEM fields has increased from 20 per cent to 24 per cent.
The gender gap in STEM-related
fields is consistent with a
persistent numeracy gap at the
adult level, despite the improving
numeracy scores for both genders
and strong literacy scores in
international comparisons.

Earnings and Participation in the Labour Market
Strong labour market conditions and reduced child care costs have helped to
foster greater participation in the workforce. Despite this progress, continued
efforts are required to secure equal participation for women and other
underrepresented groups.
Labour Force Participation Rate, 25-54 Years (%)* **
Gender gaps in earnings have
narrowed over the past few decades,
with the gap in annual earnings
reduced to 25 per cent (10 per cent
for full-time hourly wages). Still,
women, along with Indigenous
people, racialised groups, and
newcomers, are overrepresented in
low-wage work. Women’s
involuntary part-time employment
(working part-time because they are
unable to find a full-time job or are forced to work fewer hours due to economic
or business conditions) has declined, yet women’s full-time employment rate
remains 10 percentage points lower than that of men, which is partly due to
greater caregiving responsibilities.
Representation in Leadership Roles
Despite the progress in increasing women’s representation in leadership
positions, Canada’s societal makeup is not yet reflected at all levels of decision-
making. The power gap persists in business sector leadership, with the
proportions of women on boards at publicly traded companies, in senior
management positions, and in entrepreneurship all remaining below one-third.

IMPACTS REPORT 7
Canada has achieved gender parity in the Senate, with near-parity in Cabinet,
among federally appointed judges and a majority-women Supreme Court.
However, women occupy less than one-third of seats in the House of
Commons, which highlights potential systemic barriers that may deter women
from engaging in federal politics. Yet importantly, the new government has the
largest women’s caucus in recent history. At 39 per cent, this gap is smaller for
provincial and territorial legislators in Canada. Additionally, significant diversity
gaps remain in policing.
Poverty Risk and Health Outcomes
Certain vulnerable groups remain disproportionately affected by poverty
including single people, lone-parent families, and racialised populations.
These groups often face systemic
barriers to financial security,
making them more vulnerable to
financial instability, food
insecurity, and lack of adequate
affordable housing.
Cost of living pressures continued
to drive an increase in the
proportion of Canadians who
experience severe food insecurity in 2024, a trend that has continued since
2020. Lone-parent families, of which 78 per cent are headed by women,
continue to experience the
highest rates of food insecurity,
alongside Indigenous people,
visible minority populations,
and children, underscoring the
continued economic
vulnerability of certain
populations.

Disaggregated Data on Gender Equality: In early 2025, the Department of Finance
Canada partnered with Statistics Canada to launch new interactive dashboards to
modernise how gender and diversity outcomes are reported. Using digital tools these
dashboards deliver more efficient and user-friendly reporting. The dashboards can be

IMPACTS REPORT 19
Gender and Diversity Impact Summaries
Launching the Major Projects Office
Funding to the Major Projects Office, which will serve as a “single window” to advance major projects in
Canada and streamline federal regulatory project approval.
This measure will benefit all Canadians, as the Office will help accelerate nation-building projects that
contribute to long-term prosperity. The major projects the Office could support are spread across a range
of sectors and regions. Economic opportunities in construction and natural resources would indirectly
benefit more men, as women comprise less than 30 per cent of the workforce in both sectors.
Federal Initiative on Consultation
Funding to Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada to continue supporting Indigenous
participation in consultation processes through the Federal Initiative on Consultation, including for
projects of national interest.
This measure would directly benefit Indigenous communities by enhancing their capacity to participate in
Crown consultation processes, ensuring that the perspectives, rights, and interests of implicated First
Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities are understood during major project development. Coordinated
and more predictable Crown-Indigenous consultations will contribute to greater certainty for all parties,
providing a clear path for Indigenous communities to contribute to, and benefit from, projects of national
interest. As Indigenous people have a lower average annual income than non-Indigenous people in
Canada, support for Indigenous participation in consultation processes is expected to benefit primarily
lower-income communities.
Boosting Major Project Financing
Proposes guidance to the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB), Export Development Canada, Canada Growth
Fund, and the Canada Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corporation (CILGC) to work with the Major Projects
Office to coordinate federal financing for nation-building projects and follow a strategic financing
framework. It also proposes to increase CIB’s statutory capital envelope from $35 billion to $45 billion and
proposes more ways for CILGC to guarantee Indigenous investment in new build projects, and to enable
the CIB to invest in any nation-building projects that have been referred to the Major Projects Office.
This measure would benefit all Canadians, as an increased statutory capital envelope will finance more
projects that are in the public interest. Improved coordination between federal Crown corporations will
help catalyse private investment, support the Canadian economy, and accelerate nation-building projects,
while delivering value for money for taxpayers. This measure will also benefit Indigenous groups, as it will
facilitate Indigenous investment in new build projects.
Immediate Expensing for Manufacturing and Processing Buildings
The measure would provide immediate expensing for manufacturing and processing buildings.
The measure would benefit businesses in manufacturing and processing industries. Owners and shareholders
of businesses tend to be men, older, and have higher incomes. Resulting indirect employment opportunities
would predominantly benefit men., since they are more likely to work in the manufacturing or processing
sector, but would be more balanced with respect to income. More broadly, investment in capital that could
improve business productivity would be of benefit to all Canadians.
Accelerated Capital Cost Allowances for Low-Carbon Liquefied Natural Gas Facilities
The measures would reinstate accelerated capital cost allowances for liquefied natural gas equipment and
related buildings, but only for low-carbon liquefied natural gas facilities. To be eligible, a facility would
need to meet new high standards of emissions performance. Two levels of support would be available,
which would depend on the emissions performance of a facility. Details regarding the new emissions
performance requirements for these additional allowances will be provided at a later date.
The measures would benefit businesses in the natural gas liquefaction industry. Owners and shareholders
of businesses tend to be men, older, and have higher incomes. Resulting indirect employment
opportunities would predominantly benefit men. These benefits would be concentrated in British
Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, where Canada’s natural gas production is primarily located.
Currently, most liquefied natural gas projects are planned to be located in British Columbia.
-- 463 of 493 --

20 ANNEX 6
Enhancing the Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax Incentives
This measure would modify the Scientific Research and Experimental Development tax incentive
program by increasing, from $4.5 to $6 million, the expenditure limit on which the program’s
enhanced 35-per-cent tax credit can be earned.
This measure would benefit businesses that perform research and development (R&D). Owners and
shareholders of businesses tend to be men, older, and have higher incomes. Workers in industries
and occupations where business R&D is more prevalent, who are also more likely to be men and
have higher income, could also indirectly benefit. However, as technological and scientific
advancements could diffuse throughout the economy and generate productivity gains, benefits
could spread to all Canadians.
Seizing the Full Potential of Artificial Intelligence
Funding to support large-scale sovereign public artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure that will
boost AI compute availability and support access to sovereign AI compute capacity.
This measure will primarily benefit highly educated men in the regions of British Columbia, Alberta,
Ontario, and Québec where the majority of the AI ecosystem is concentrated. Approximately 70 per
cent of AI workers are men with tertiary/advanced degrees. Around 50 per cent of AI jobs are
classified as ‘well paying’ with annual salaries in the range of $82,000 or more. This measure will
also indirectly support Canadian industry and academia and provide additional benefits to the
Canadian AI ecosystem, such as increasing productivity.
Artificial Intelligence and Technology Measurement Program
Funding to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Technology Measurement Program (TechStat), to
support data and insights to measure how AI is used by organisations and understand its impact on
Canadian society, the labour force, and the economy.
This measure will benefit all Canadians by providing policy makers with timely and relevant data to
conduct thorough analysis and better understand technology’s contribution to, and impact on,
businesses, government, and Canadians. This measure will also provide data and insights on access
to digital infrastructure and technology use across different demographic characteristics.
Protecting Canadian Intellectual Property
Funding to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada and the National Research
Council of Canada to renew Elevate IP as well as the Innovation Asset Collective and IP Assist, to
continue to support Canadian SMEs with their intellectual property (IP) needs.
This measure would directly benefit innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with the
potential to own IP. Innovative SMEs are majority owned by men (65.6 per cent) and SME owners
are typically highly educated.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Women, Indigenous people, and racialised communities may face
challenges in accessing IP services. To address these barriers, the Elevate IP program requires
recipients to develop and implement Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility Action Plans, and
directs targeted supports to underrepresented groups to provide access to IP services.
Investing to Build High-Growth Companies and Emerging Fund Managers
Funding for the Business Development Bank of Canada to launch the Venture and Growth Capital
Catalyst Initiative, a fund-of-funds that would incentivise pension funds and other institutional
investor participation, as well as funding for the government to develop and implement a new
strategy that supports firms facing early growth-stage funding gaps.
Men are expected to disproportionately benefit from this initiative, as they are overrepresented
among venture capital fund managers and entrepreneurs receiving investments from these fund
managers. Indirect benefits are expected to accrue more broadly to workers employed by
entrepreneurs receiving investments, as well as investors who may benefit from a strengthened
innovation ecosystem and the long-term growth of high-potential companies. This initiative may
benefit those with middle to higher incomes, including investors and employees of high-growth
potential companies.

IMPACTS REPORT 21
2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan
The 2026-2028 Immigration Levels Plan stabilises permanent resident admission targets at 380,000
per year for three years, while setting a target for new temporary resident arrivals at 385,000 in
2026 and 370,000 in 2027 and 2028. In addition, over the next two years, Canada will undertake a
one-time measure to recognize eligible Protected Persons in Canada as permanent residents and a
one-time measure to accelerate the conversion of up to 33,000 work permit holders to permanent
residency.
These measures would benefit newcomers to Canada by supporting their integration, which
contributes to positive economic and social outcomes. Newcomer men have a moderately higher
employment rate than their Canadian-born counterparts, while newcomer women face significant
labour market challenges, with lower employment rates compared to Canadian-born women.
Establishing immigration targets also contributes to a sustainable and well-managed immigration
system and supports long-term economic, social, and cultural benefits for all Canadians.
Improving Foreign Credential Recognition
Funding to Employment and Social Development Canada to work with provinces and territories to
improve the fairness, transparency, timeliness, and consistency of foreign credential recognition
processes, with a focus on health and construction sectors.
This measure would benefit internationally trained professionals, with a post-secondary degree
seeking employment in a regulated occupation, particularly in the health and construction sectors.
Both women and men, who are overrepresented in the health and skilled trades sectors
respectively, would benefit. While newcomers are highly educated, with nearly half having at least a
bachelor’s degree, they face higher unemployment and overqualification compared to those who are
Canadian-born and are less likely to find employment in their field. Racialised people, who make up
roughly 80 per cent of newcomers, would benefit significantly.
Recruiting International Talent
Launching the International Talent Attraction Strategy to recruit top-tier international researchers to
Canadian universities to strengthen the Canadian research ecosystem.
This measure is expected to benefit all Canadians by driving economic growth. It would also directly
benefit top-performing international researchers and Canadian post secondary institutions, who
would benefit from the recruited talent’s research expertise. Top-tier researchers tend to have
higher incomes.
Catalysing Investment in Airports and Ports
Exploring potential improvements under the National Airports System (NAS) governance model,
including amendments to ground leases and measures to crowd-in additional private investment,
including from institutional investors.
This measure is expected to benefit Canadian and international travellers who use NAS airports by
supporting investments in airport infrastructure and amenities while keeping airport user fees
competitive through improved efficiency. Based on Statistics Canada’s Survey of Household
Spending (2023), the propensity to fly for personal travel is highly correlated to income. As a result,
this measure is likely to have a greater impact on high- and middle-income Canadians.
Investing in Local and Regional Airports
Funding to Transport Canada to support safety-related infrastructure projects at local and regional
airports.
This measure would directly benefit rural and remote communities by maintaining essential air
connectivity. This access is vital for timely health care, fresh food delivery, and broader economic
development. One in nine Canadians lives in a community deemed ‘moderately,’ ‘more,’ or ‘most’
remote, with Indigenous people likely to live in more remote regions. The construction and
engineering sectors would indirectly benefit from new infrastructure projects, with the workforce in
these sectors being disproportionately men (e.g., 86.4 per cent in the construction sector).
-- 465 of 493 --

22 ANNEX 6
Generational Infrastructure Investments
Launching a new Build Communities Strong Fund to support public infrastructure projects of local
and regional significance.
This measure will benefit all Canadians through investments in public infrastructure, across a wide
range of infrastructure classes, with the likelihood of impacts varying by project type and geographic
location. This measure would indirectly benefit the construction sector, which predominantly
employs men (86.4 per cent) of working age with medium income.
Extending the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Investment Tax Credit
Extending by five years the full credit rates under the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)
investment tax credit, from 2031 to 2035. Credit rates would be reduced by half from 2036 to 2040.
This measure would benefit businesses in the utilities, manufacturing, processing, engineering, oil
and gas and construction sectors—particularly those located in Western Canada. Shareholders and
employees of businesses that invest in CCUS would directly benefit. Generally, these groups are
disproportionately older men and high-income earners. Increased economic activity from the
measure would have a positive impact on GDP per capita. The emission reductions will positively
impact all Canadians, but in particular youth and future generations, by reducing the negative
impacts associated with climate change.
Expanding the List of Critical Minerals for the Clean Technology Manufacturing
Investment Tax Credit
The measure would expand the list of eligible critical minerals for the Clean Technology
Manufacturing investment tax credit to include the production of antimony, indium, gallium,
germanium, and scandium.
This measure would directly benefit eligible corporations and may encourage incremental investment
in extraction and processing related to critical minerals used in clean technologies. This increased
investment may contribute to firm growth and increased productivity of workers in Canada, leading to
higher wages. Workers in mining, quarrying, oil, or gas tend to earn higher income than the average
Canadian and are disproportionately men (82 per cent), working-aged (90 per cent), or Indigenous (9
per cent). All Canadians will benefit from investments towards a low-carbon economy, particularly
younger generations and vulnerable populations including women, Indigenous people, and people in
rural communities, who are disproportionately impacted by climate change.
Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund
Funding to Natural Resources Canada to create the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, which will
make strategic investments in critical minerals projects and companies, including equity investments,
loan guarantees, and offtake agreements.
All Canadians would benefit from positive impacts on Canada’s growth and productivity through
increased investment in critical minerals projects and companies in Canada. The measure would
directly benefit workers in the mining sector, who are predominantly men, as well as Canadians who
reside in rural and remote communities, including Indigenous Peoples (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) and
people who reside in Canada’s North where many potential mining opportunities exist. The measure
may offer opportunities for Indigenous economic reconciliation and support local employment
growth. Indirect benefits would accrue to people employed in the construction and transportation
sectors through temporary employment. Workers in these sectors are disproportionately men.
First and Last Mile Fund
Funding to Natural Resources Canada to create the First and Last Mile Fund to foster the
development of Canada’s critical minerals value chains.
All Canadians would benefit from positive impacts on Canada’s growth and productivity through
increased supply chain efficiency and new market opportunities in the mining sector. Direct benefits
would accrue to owners, operators, and users of mining infrastructure. Mining projects are largely
located in rural and remote regions of the country. This measure would indirectly benefit workers in
the mining industry, which predominantly employs men of core working-age (ages 25 to 54) who
earn wages that exceed the national average across. Indigenous people account for 11 per cent of
mining’s labour force, amongst the highest representation by industry in Canada.

IMPACTS REPORT 23
Expansion of the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit
Expanding the eligibility of the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit to include additional critical
minerals. This measure would apply to expenditures renounced under eligible flow-through share
agreements entered into after Budget Day and on or before March 31, 2027.
The measure would benefit individuals who invest in flow-through shares of mining exploration
companies. These individuals tend to be men with higher incomes. Businesses engaged in mineral
exploration would also benefit. Mining workers, who tend to be men, and some communities,
including Northern and Indigenous communities, may also indirectly benefit. The measure may
incentivise the future supply of certain critical minerals.
Mobilising Capital for Transition to Net-Zero
Selection of an external organisation to lead the development of made-in-Canada sustainable
investment guidelines (also known as a taxonomy).
Made-in-Canada sustainable investment guidelines could improve the functioning of the financial
system, which would benefit all Canadians. However, men, high-income people, and seniors who
tend to be wealthier and have more investments could disproportionately benefit. Furthermore,
sustainable investment guidelines could have downstream benefits for all Canadians, especially
younger generations, and vulnerable populations, including women, Indigenous people, and rural
and coastal communities, who are disproportionately impacted by climate change, by mobilising
capital in support of Canada’s net-zero transition.
Legislative Amendments Related to Climate Competitiveness Strategy
Introducing amendments to the Competition Act, the Energy Efficiency Act, and the Canadian
Environmental Protection Act, 1999 to support investment certainty and the adoption of energy
efficient goods.
All Canadians are expected to benefit from this measure. While the amendments are expected to
have no significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions, they are expected to provide greater
investment certainty and offer legislative or regulatory efficiencies.
Reducing Barriers to Account Switching
Introducing regulations that would prohibit transfer fees, introduce transfer timelines, and enhance
disclosures related to registered and investment account transfers. The government also intends to
work with banks on ways to simplify the process of switching primary chequing accounts.
These measures will benefit all Canadians, as they are aimed at improving competition in the
financial sector generally. If Canadians are more readily able to transfer deposit, registered or
investment accounts to other financial institutions, financial institutions will compete for clients
more vigorously, resulting in lower prices and/or better-quality services for all Canadians. Canadians
holding registered and investment accounts, which are more prevalent among higher-income
people, may disproportionately benefit, as these transfers will be smoother and less costly.
Bank Fees Report
The government is requesting that the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) prepare a
report on the structure level and transparency of fees charged by Canadian banks.
The FCAC report is expected to enhance public understanding of the level and transparency of bank
fees in Canada, which will benefit all Canadians.
Helping Credit Unions Grow and Compete
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act and
other statutes as needed to make entrance requirements for federal credit unions less burdensome
and make it easier for federal credit unions to scale through amalgamations and acquisitions.
All Canadians will benefit from improvements to the federal credit union framework since allowing
more financial institutions like credit unions to grow will create more competition in the financial
sector. Competition drives down fees, improves interest rates on deposits, and leads to better
customer services as banks compete for market share, bringing benefits to the diverse regions
across Canada that credit unions serve. Competition in the sector can also drive efficiency and
support economic development and productivity as banks are driven to allocate capital to their most
productive uses.

24 ANNEX 6
Allow Small FRFIs to Grow Larger Without Changing Ownership Structure
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to raise the threshold for the 35 per cent public holding requirement from $2 billion
to $4 billion.
This measure is expected to help small financial institutions grow and compete. All Canadians will
benefit from improvements that support the growth and competitiveness of smaller financial
institutions, because increased competition in the financial sector supports lower prices and better-
quality financial services.
Strengthening Small Banks’ Access for Brokered Deposits
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Bank Act to prevent banks from unduly limiting access to
their distribution channels for brokered deposits.
All Canadians will benefit from improvements that support the growth and competitiveness of
smaller financial institutions, which supports lower prices and high-quality financial services.
Advancing Consumer-Driven Banking
Proposes legislation to complete the Consumer-Driven Banking Framework, transferring its
governance to the Bank of Canada, and a legislative amendment to the Personal Information
Protection and Electronic Documents Act that will grant Canadians a right to data mobility, supporting
an economy-wide approach to data sharing.
All Canadians are expected to benefit from this measure, as it will promote competition and reduce
risks in the financial services industry by regulating financial data sharing. For consumers, this could
mean greater financial inclusion, more informed financial decisions, and better management and
mitigation of financial stressors. For businesses, it could mean improved access to new forms of
financing and reduced administrative burden from better integration and automation of key
functions.
Introducing a Regulated Space for Stablecoins
Introducing regulations for the safe innovation of digital assets by regulating the issuance of fiat-
backed stablecoins.
Regulating stablecoin issuance will benefit all Canadians by ensuring that stablecoins are backed by
quality reserves, with appropriate redemption policies established and appropriate safeguards for
data security and risk management. While all Canadians will benefit, research done by the Financial
Consumer Agency of Canada in 2023-2024 has found that men and young Canadians are more
likely to own stablecoins, meaning that this measure will disproportionately benefit them by
ensuring those assets are secure.
Restricting Non-Compete Agreements
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Canada Labour Code to restrict non-compete agreements
that distort the labour market while hindering competition and labour mobility.
This measure is expected to benefit workers across Canada by improving job matches and reducing
barriers to labour mobility. Higher competition for talent is expected to raise wages and
productivity, supporting broad-based gains across age, education, and income groups.
Improving VIA Rail Service in the Corridor
Funding proposed for VIA Rail Canada to implement technologies to improve on-time performance
on its corridor services.
This measure would directly benefit people who use VIA Rail’s corridor services. Across all VIA Rail
routes, women make up 60 per cent of ridership, young people and students make up 20 per cent,
and seniors make up 13 per cent.
-- 468 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 25
Supporting Medical School Infrastructure
Funding to support Toronto Metropolitan University’s (TMU) School of Medicine through the
construction of a new student building at TMU’s Brampton campus and to establish primary care
teaching clinics in surrounding communities.
This measure will benefit the TMU School of Medicine. Direct beneficiaries would be students of
the medical school, as support for auxiliary infrastructure will improve their experiences. In 2020,
the Association of Faculties of Medicine in Canada estimated that enrollment in Canadian medical
schools is broadly gender balanced, but that enrollees were less likely than the census average to be
Black, Indigenous, or from rural areas. Indirect benefits are expected to accrue to communities
around TMU that will be served by new primary care teaching clinics. Longer-term benefits will
accrue to all Canadians through an increased number of certified doctors and healthcare
professionals.
Landfill Methane Regulations
Funding to Environment and Climate Change Canada to implement and enforce methane
regulations for large landfills.
Reducing emissions of methane, which are a potent greenhouse gas, is expected to reduce health
care costs and lower health impacts from poor air quality, which would benefit those who are
especially vulnerable to pollution, including seniors, children and those with pre-existing medical
conditions. Reducing emissions provides the greatest benefit to future generations, in terms of
reduced climate impacts.
Becoming Our Own Best Customer
Funding to Public Services and Procurement Canada, the Treasury Board Secretariat, and
Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada to implement a Buy Canadian Policy,
enabling more Canadian companies to participate in federal procurement.
This measure would benefit Canadian businesses by prioritising Canadian suppliers in federal
procurement contracts, which would spur domestic demand and create potential opportunities for
growth. As this includes a specific priority to ensure the steel and softwood lumber sectors are
supported, this measure would likely benefit men more, as they are overrepresented in these
sectors. Small- and medium-sized businesses will also benefit from a specific program under this
new policy. About 65 per cent of small- and medium-sized businesses are owned by men.
Trade Infrastructure Strategy
Funding to support the development of trade and transportation infrastructure through the creation
of the Trade Diversification Corridors Fund (TDCF) and Arctic Infrastructure Fund (AIF).
This measure would benefit all Canadians, by positively impacting Canada’s growth trajectory,
productivity, and GDP per capita through increased supply chain efficiency and by facilitating new
market opportunities for Canadian businesses. Direct benefits would accrue to owners, operators,
and users of infrastructure facilitated by the TDCF and AIF across a variety of regions, with the AIF
particularly benefiting transportation users in northern regions. Users of supported infrastructure
would generally be Canadian businesses looking to export and import goods. Indirect benefits would
accrue to the construction and transportation industries, which predominantly employ men: in the
2021 Census, 86.4 per cent of those working in the construction industry identified as men.
Making New Business-to-Business Connections in Europe
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to undertake new Minister-led trade missions to the European
Union (EU) and offer financial support to Chambers of Commerce in the region.
This measure would benefit Canadian companies, and their employees that are seeking new
business ties with Europe. By promoting expanded trade and investment with Europe, this measure
will directly enhance economic growth, helping to create a stronger Canadian economy for the
benefit of all Canadians.
-- 469 of 493 --

26 ANNEX 6
Removing Barriers and Modernising Trade
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to enhance capacity to negotiate and implement trade and
investment related agreements.
This measure would benefit Canadian businesses by increasing Canada’s capacity to advance trade
and investment agreements, which play a key role in opening new markets for Canadian exporters
and reducing the barriers businesses face under existing agreements. By increasing opportunities for
Canadian businesses to diversify trade, this measure would directly enhance economic growth,
helping to create a stronger Canadian economy for the benefit of all Canadians.
Seizing International Opportunities Through Trade Finance
Funding to create a concessional trade finance envelope, delivered by Export Development Canada
to encourage international partners to buy Canadian.
Workers at Canadian companies that export capital goods and/or undertake large projects overseas
would benefit from this measure. Median wages in utilities, construction, manufacturing, and
professional, scientific & technical services are at or above the overall median (up to 67 per cent
higher), with men making up around 70 per cent of employment across these sectors. In addition,
this measure is expected to benefit buyers and communities in developing countries, as it lowers the
cost of borrowing for projects that can support long-term growth.
Revitalising CanExport
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to expand the CanExport program to better support Canadian
companies in diversifying their exports to markets abroad.
This measure would benefit Canadian companies, including the owners and employees, seeking to
export their products to new markets. Men may disproportionately benefit, as they have higher
ownership of businesses in Canada (65 per cent). Although the CanExport program is open to all
Canadian-owned companies, the majority of participants are small- and medium-sized enterprises.
Support to help these companies expand their exports and reach new markets will increase growth
and make the Canadian economy more resilient, benefitting all Canadians.
Support Canadian Firms’ Innovation-to-Export Pipeline
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to support Canadian firms’ innovation-to-export pipeline.
This measure would benefit Canadian technology companies seeking to access international
markets or expand their export opportunities. By promoting domestic competitiveness through
innovation and international partnerships, this measure would directly enhance economic growth,
helping to create a stronger Canadian economy for the benefit of all Canadians.
SME Export Readiness Initiative
Funding to Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada for the small- and medium-
sized enterprises (SME) Export Readiness Initiative, to support training to help SMEs develop
capabilities to enter and be successful in international markets.
This measure would benefit all SMEs which are newly exporting or wanting to start exporting. As
such, the program will benefit owners and employees of such SMEs. Men may disproportionately
benefit, as they are more likely to be majority owners of SMEs (65 per cent).
Nuclear Energy Export Promotion
Funding to Natural Resources Canada to maintain capacity to promote nuclear energy exports and
strategic engagement in key export markets.
All Canadians would benefit from diversification of nuclear energy exports, which can support new
opportunities for Canadian firms and helps make our trade more resilient. Successful nuclear energy
export promotion would directly benefit those employed in the nuclear industry and related supply
chains. Women are underrepresented in the Canadian nuclear sector, making up about 22 per cent
of the workforce in 2021. Salaries in the sector range from middle income to upper middle income.
-- 470 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 27
Expanded Clean Technology Demonstration Initiative
Funding to National Research Council of Canada’s Industrial Research Assistance Program to
expand the Clean Technology Demonstration initiative to global markets.
This measure would benefit Canadian SMEs by supporting the demonstration and deployment of
clean technology solutions. In 2023, 65 per cent of Canadian SMEs were majority owned by men,
17 per cent were majority owned by women and 18 per cent were owned equally by men and
women. Additionally, as of 2023, approximately 71 per cent of the environment and clean
technology workforce were men, and the sector’s annual wage was 38.8 per cent higher than the
national average. The measure is also expected to generate long-term indirect benefits for all
Canadians by supporting the transition to a net-zero economy.
Enhancing Canada’s Trade Access Through Digital Modernisation
Funding to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to enhance its digital capacity to enable the
safe and efficient trade of agricultural and agri-food products.
This measure would benefit producers and processors looking to export their agrifood and seafood
products as it would enable a more efficient trading system, reducing burden on firms and time for
requests to be processed. The agriculture sector predominately employs men, with a higher
proportion of workers who are older in the case of farm operators, and who also have a higher
average family income compared to all Canadians.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: The greater use of digital systems may create barriers for some
firms (e.g. with limited access to high-speed internet) or persons with disabilities (e.g. with visual
impairments). However, digital systems may make it easier for some to more efficiently access these
services, as manual processes require access to transportation, efficient mail service, fine motor
skills for signing, etc. The CFIA will gather real-time feedback to assess and address potential
challenges, including by maintaining access to paper-based forms for users having difficulty with
online systems.
Securing Market Access for Agri-Food and Seafood
Funding to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to enable two-way trade in agriculture and
seafood, such as to enable regulatory compliance to access foreign markets.
These efforts are expected to benefit workers and firms in the agriculture and agri-food sectors,
including manufacturing, currently or looking to trade internationally. The agriculture sector
predominately employs men, with a higher proportion of workers who are older in the case of farm
operators, and who also have a higher average family income compared to all Canadians.
Migrate the Canada Tariff Finder to the Trade Commissioner Service’s Digital Experience
Platform
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to maintain the Canada Tariff Finder. The site provides essential
information on tariff rates in world markets to Canadian companies and individuals.
This measure would benefit all Canadians, but notably business owners that import or export
products to other countries, as well as individuals seeking tariff information about specific markets.
With greater transparency on global tariff rates, Canadian businesses can plan more effectively,
avoid unexpected costs, and strengthen their competitiveness abroad to help grow a stronger
Canadian economy.
Implement Trade Controls to Defend Canada’s Steel Industry
Funding to Global Affairs Canada to support the effective implementation of trade controls to
defend the steel industry from trade diversion and global excess capacity.
This measure will have direct positive impacts for workers in the steel sector. It is expected that this
measure will primarily benefit working-age men, given that they are overrepresented (over 80 per
cent) in the workforce composition of the primary metals manufacturing sector in Canada, with
regional concentration in Ontario and Québec. On average, workers in the primary metal
manufacturing sector earned over $130,000 of total annual compensation in 2024 (including
benefits and pension.
-- 471 of 493 --

28 ANNEX 6
Enhancing Economic Expertise on Exporting Sectors
Funding to Global Affairs Canada, to support of augmenting economic analysis and policy expertise
on exporting sectors.
This measure would benefit Canadian businesses by increasing Canada’s capacity to advance trade
and investment agreements, which play a key role in opening new markets for Canadian exporters
and reducing the barriers businesses face under existing agreements. By enabling more refined
targeting of opportunities for Canadian businesses to diversify trade, this measure would directly
enhance economic growth, helping to create a stronger Canadian economy for the benefit of all
Canadians.
Amendments to AgriStability
Funding for amendments to the FPT cost-shared AgriStability program to make pasture-related feed
costs eligible under the program.
This measure will directly benefit livestock producers who have pasture-related feed charges, such
as cow/calf, sheep, and goat producers. Primary beneficiaries are more likely to be older, White
men, given the demographic makeup of the livestock sector. Cow/calf, sheep, and goat farming
operations are located across Canada, with higher representation in certain provinces. The majority
of cow/calf producers are located in Alberta (40 per cent), Saskatchewan (27 per cent), and
Manitoba (17 per cent). The majority of sheep and goat operations are located in Ontario (35 per
cent), British Columbia (19 per cent), Québec (18 per cent), and Alberta (12 per cent).
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: While specific barriers to program participation are not known at
this time, the government recognises that underrepresented and marginalised groups in the sector
can face barriers in accessing financial resources. Collection of disaggregated data under the
AgriStability program is beginning on a voluntary basis in fall 2025. This will help to better
understand the demographic groups represented among AgriStability participants, and barriers to
accessing the program.
Launching Build Canada Homes
Funding and proposed legislation for Build Canada Homes, to support the construction of affordable
homes and a more productive homebuilding industry.
The expected impact is to increase the number of homes across Canada, increase the size of the non-
market housing sector, increase productivity in the housing sector, and improve housing affordability.
Increasing affordable and non-market housing will benefit groups in greatest need of affordable
housing, including lower-income individuals and families, and equity-seeking groups, including
Indigenous people, racialised people, women, seniors and persons with disabilities. This measure will
also indirectly benefit men, who are more likely to work in construction and account for 86.4 per
cent of employees in this sector.
First-Time Home Buyers’ GST Rebate
This measure would eliminate the GST on new homes valued at or under $1 million for first-time
home buyers and reduce the GST on new homes valued between $1 million and $1.5 million for
first-time home buyers.
This measure would benefit Canadians who do not yet own their home. This group is mostly 34
years old or younger, roughly gender-balanced and has a higher median household income
compared to the median Canadian household income.
-- 472 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 29
Training the Next Generation of Canadian Builders
Funding to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) to help develop the trades
workforce by expanding the Union Training and Innovation Program.
This measure would benefit unionised apprentices, union groups and employers in Red Seal trades by
supporting the training of apprentices and building Canada’s trades workforce. According to ESDC,
men account for 89 per cent of apprentices in Red Seal trade programs compared to 11 per cent of
women. The median age for new apprentices in Red Seal training is 25 years old. Also, 2021 Census
data shows that approximately 77 per cent of workers in Red Seal trade occupations were White.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Women, persons with disabilities, people who identify as
Indigenous, 2SLGBTQI+ people, racialised people, and newcomers are underrepresented in
apprenticeship training programs. These groups face a range of barriers including lack of mentors,
inaccessible workplaces, and limited outreach targeting their participation. To address these barriers,
ESDC will give priority to projects that include equity groups in apprenticeship training and use
innovative approaches to address challenges these groups face in participating and succeeding in
the Red Seal trades.
Strengthening First Nations Infrastructure Financing and Access to Clean Water
Funding to Indigenous Services Canada to support First Nations’ access to safe and clean drinking
water and effective wastewater management on reserves. The government will also continue to
explore new financing tools to expand options available to First Nations to advance their
infrastructure priorities, such as the creation of a bonding and surety pilot project for First Nations
contractors on-reserve and a standalone pilot scheme to monetize federal transfers to support
financing for First Nations infrastructure on reserve.
This measure will benefit First Nations communities on reserve by enabling the continued operation,
maintenance, repair, and replacement of water and wastewater infrastructure and access to
financing tools available to communities to advance their infrastructure priorities. Reliable access to
clean, safe drinking water has a direct positive impact on economic and social outcomes, including
productivity, educational attainment, and overall health and well-being. Those expected to benefit
most directly include lower-income community members, those more vulnerable to health
complications (such as young children, elders, and persons with disabilities), and their caregivers.
Since women are most likely to take on caregiver roles in their families and communities, they are
also expected to disproportionately benefit from this measure.
Supporting Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure
Raising the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s target for investments in Indigenous infrastructure that
benefit First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities across its priority sectors. The government will
work with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis partners to identify and support Indigenous housing needs
and priorities.
This measure will benefit Indigenous communities by supporting the construction of community
infrastructure projects. The construction and operation of infrastructure in Indigenous communities
is expected increase employment opportunities for Indigenous people residing in those communities
with further benefits flowing from indirect economic development opportunities catalysed by
investments in infrastructure. This measure will also benefit First Nations, Inuit, and Métis
communities by improving access to affordable housing. Reliable access to adequate housing is
directly related to improved socio-economic outcomes (e.g., educational, productivity and physical
and mental health) with benefits disproportionately experienced by lower-income households.
The Middle-Class Tax Cut
Reducing the lowest marginal personal income tax rate from 15 per cent to 14 per cent, effective
July 1, 2025.
Nearly all Canadians who owe personal income tax would benefit from this measure. Average tax
savings are expected to be higher for individuals with taxable income exceeding the first tax bracket
($57,375 in 2025), though the bulk of total tax relief would go to those in the two lowest brackets,
including nearly half to those in the first bracket. Individuals claiming large non-refundable tax
credits, and Canadians under the age of 18 who tend not to owe tax may benefit less. The measure
is expected to be gender balanced, with 52 per cent and 48 per cent of benefiting individuals being
men and women, respectively.
-- 473 of 493 --

30 ANNEX 6
Cancelling the Divisive Consumer Carbon Price
On March 14, 2025, the government announced that the federal fuel charge will cease to apply,
effective April 1, 2025, and also removed requirements for provinces and territories to have a
consumer-facing carbon price as of that date. Direct fuel charge proceeds return mechanisms for
Canadians, small- and medium-sized businesses, farmers, and Indigenous governments are also
being wound down. Residents of provinces where the fuel charge applied received a final Canada
Carbon Rebate payment in April 2025.
All Canadians would benefit from lower fuel costs, but the net impact of removing the fuel charge
and winding down proceeds return mechanisms will depend on consumption of fuel by households,
farmers, small- and medium-sized businesses, and Indigenous governments.
Delivering Automatic Federal Benefits for Low-Income Individuals
The measure would provide pre-filled income tax returns starting for the 2026 tax year that would
reach up to 5.5 million low-income Canadians by the 2028 tax year. The measure would also grant
the Canada Revenue Agency the legislative authority to file a tax return on behalf of certain eligible
individuals with lower incomes.
The pre-filled income tax returns and legislative changes would increase the amount of federal
benefits distributed to eligible individuals. Eligible individuals would generally have income below
the federal Basic Personal Amount of $16,129. The eligible population would be relatively gender
balanced, with 54 per cent being men and 46 per cent being women, and age balanced.
Making the National School Food Program Permanent
New legislation and funding to Employment and Social Development Canada, Indigenous Services
Canada, and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada to make the National School
Food Program permanent.
This measure will primarily benefit children through improved learning outcomes, particularly for
those who are at higher risk of experiencing food insecurity. Data from Statistics Canada shows that
in 2022, 16.9 per cent of Canadians were food insecure, compared with 12.9 per cent in 2021.
Overall, the proportion of people living in households experiencing food insecurity has increased by
5.3 percentage points from 2018 to 2022. Studies from Statistics Canada show that children living
in lone-parent families (particularly women lone-parent families), children belonging to racialised
group or Indigenous children are at a greater risk of experiencing food insecurity.
Enhancing Access to Funds Deposited by Cheque
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, and amendments to the Financial Consumer
Protection Framework Regulations and the Access to Funds Regulations to increase and speed up
access to funds deposited using cheques.
Increasing the amount of cheque funds available immediately would benefit low-income Canadians
and seniors by helping to reduce reliance on costly short-term credit, such as payday loans or
overdraft protection, or avoid non-sufficient funds fees. These groups are more likely to receive
wages or benefits by cheque and have limited savings or credit access. Data from Statistics Canada
shows that these households are about twice as likely to report difficulty meeting short-term
obligations. Faster access to deposited funds would help with timely bill payments, reduce penalty
fees, and ease financial stress, supporting greater financial inclusion and stability across vulnerable
populations.
-- 474 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 31
Code of Conduct for the Prevention of Economic Abuse
Working with stakeholders and banks to develop a voluntary Code of Conduct for the Prevention of
Economic Abuse.
This measure would benefit groups most affected by economic abuse including women, lower-
income households, Indigenous communities, and racialised Canadians. Data from 2018 shows that
Indigenous women are three times more likely to experience financial abuse by an intimate partner
compared to non-Indigenous women. Further, a 2022 study found that economic abuse appears to
be more prevalent among women than men, and among racialised groups than White populations.
The same study found that about 50 per cent of those with household incomes less than $30,000
have experienced economic abuse.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Economic abuse does not affect all groups equally. Women,
seniors, newcomers, and persons with disabilities are more likely to experience barriers to financial
independence, compounded by intersecting factors such as language, immigration status, caregiving
responsibilities, and cultural norms. The code of conduct will be designed to reflect these diverse
experiences, reduce systemic barriers, and ensure equitable access to safe and supportive banking
services.
Protecting Workers Against Improper Classification
Funding for the Canada Revenue Agency to implement a compliance program that addresses non-
compliance issues related to contract workers, lifting the moratorium on reporting fees for service in
the trucking industry, as well as allowing the Canada Revenue Agency to share information with
Employment and Social Development Canada to address worker misclassification.
This measure would benefit truck drivers in Canada by helping ensure that they are afforded their
labour law rights and that proper income tax, Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance
withholdings and remittances are made for these individuals. Over 90 per cent of transportation
sector workers are men and approximately 35 per cent are newcomers to Canada.
Delivering for Personal Support Workers
This measure would introduce a Personal Support Workers Tax Credit, under which eligible personal
support workers could claim a refundable tax credit equal to 5 per cent of their eligible earnings,
providing support of up to $1,100 per year. It would be available for the 2026 to 2030 taxation
years.
This measure would benefit personal support workers, who are disproportionately women, Black or
racialised, newcomers, working-age and have low to modest incomes. According to the 2021
Census, around 86 per cent of personal support workers were women. Black or racialised people
were overrepresented, at around 39 per cent of all personal support workers, compared to 24 per
cent of the Canadian population aged 15 and older. The average employment income of personal
support workers was around $34,000 in 2020, compared to $50,000 for all of those aged 15 years
and over with employment income.
Helping Youth Find and Keep Jobs
Funding to support youth employment and skills development opportunities for youth under
Canada Summer Jobs, the horizontal Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, and the Student Work
Placement Program.
This measure will benefit young people through employment services, training opportunities, and
employment-related support. While Canada Summer Jobs will benefit youth, projects funded under
the horizontal Youth Employment and Skills Strategy will particularly benefit youth facing barriers to
employment (i.e., those who have not completed high school, are newcomers, are racialised, have
disabilities, or are in rural areas). Funding for the Student Work Placement Program will benefit
youth enrolled in post-secondary education. Placements funded through these programs have been,
and are expected to be, gender balanced. Employers and organisations that receive wage subsidies
or funding will indirectly benefit through improved access to labour supply.
-- 475 of 493 --

32 ANNEX 6
Advancing the Youth Climate Corps
Funding to Employment and Social Development Canada to create a Youth Climate Corps to
provide paid skills training for young Canadians.
This measure would benefit young people through additional employment and/or training
opportunities in support of climate emergency and recovery response as well as climate resilience
across the country. Youth generally have lower incomes than the general working population.
Permanent Funding for the Department for Women and Gender Equality
Funding to the Department for Women and Gender Equality to continue advancing work to ensure
all communities can benefit from the country’s economic growth and development.
This measure would directly benefit women and girls, in particular women and girls with disabilities,
Black, Indigenous and racialised women and girls, and 2SLGBTQI+ people. These groups are at
higher risk of experiencing gender-based violence and also face increased barriers in accessing
supports and services due to systemic inequalities, such as sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism
and poverty. This measure indirectly promotes equality, equity, and inclusion, benefitting all
Canadians.
Connecting Canadians Through Cultural Experiences and Community Celebrations
Funding to Canadian Heritage and Environment and Climate Change Canada, for festivals, and
community-driven cultural events across the country.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by encouraging people to attend festivals and other local
cultural events, which helps to strengthen participation, community identity, and expands cultural
access for Canadians. Canadian artists, cultural workers, volunteers, and event organisers who
participate in community events and celebrations would also benefit, by providing employment
opportunities.
Investing in Canadian Creators and the Cultural Economy
Funding to Canadian Heritage to support Canadian creators and the cultural economy. Funding will
support the Canada Music Fund, TV5MONDEplus, Telefilm, the Canada Media Fund, the National
Film Board, the Canada Council for the Arts, and the Canada Periodical Fund’s Special Measures for
Journalism.
All Canadians would benefit from cultural content, presentations, and news that reflect their local
communities and Canada’s diversity. This measure will indirectly benefit professional artists and
Canadians working in the audiovisual, performing arts, and news media sectors as a result of the
employment opportunities that would be created.
Protecting Artists’ and Creators’ Copyrights
Amendments to the Copyright Act to establish an artist's resale right in Canada.
This measure is expected to benefit visual artists in Canada, particularly Indigenous visual artists,
who make up a higher proportion of visual artists (4.1 per cent) relative to other artforms (3.1 per
cent). In 2015 visual artists had a median income of $20,000 compared to $41,000 for cultural
workers and $43,500 for all workers.
Protecting Our National Broadcaster: CBC/Radio-Canada
Funding for the CBC/Radio-Canada to strengthen its mandate to serve the public and to better
reflect the needs of Canadians from a public broadcaster in the 21 st century.
All Canadians who use CBC/Radio-Canada’s services would benefit, particularly those who do not
have access to comparable alternatives, including low-income people, residents of smaller
communities, and official language minority communities, where CBC/Radio-Canada may be the
sole or primary news provider. Older Canadians would also benefit, as they tend to rely more on
CBC/Radio-Canada’s radio and television services. A 2025 survey by Pollara Strategic Insights
showed that 44 per cent of people aged 60 and older consume CBC/Radio-Canada content “most
days”. CBC/Radio-Canada’s youth programs also have a large audience, with children’s content
averaging 2.67 million virtual visits per month in 2023-24.

IMPACTS REPORT 33
Renewing the Canada Strong Pass
Funding to renew the Canada Strong Pass between December 2025 and January 2026 as well as in
Summer 2026.
This measure will benefit all Canadians, particularly families with children under the age of 18 and
youth ages 18 to 24 given that most of the available discounts apply specifically to these groups.
Lower-income people will also benefit as the potential savings from the available discounts
represent a higher proportion of their disposable income.
Supporting the Royal Canadian Geographical Society
Funding for the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.
This measure would benefit all Canadians. However, there would be particular benefits for younger
Canadians, by providing the Royal Canadian Geographical Society with stable funding to sustain and
grow its educational and public programming.
Lowering Barriers to Access the Canada Disability Benefit
Funding for a one-time supplemental Canada Disability Benefit payment of $150 in respect of each
Disability Tax Credit certification, or re-certification, giving rise to a Canada Disability Benefit
entitlement.
This measure would benefit low-income working-age (18 to 64) persons with disabilities by
increasing their financial well-being. Statistics published with the Canada Disability Benefit
announcement in Budget 2024 based on 2017 data indicated that working-age persons with
disabilities experience poverty at about twice the rate of working-age Canadians without disabilities.
As well, among persons with disabilities, persons from racialised communities were somewhat more
likely to live in poverty, while First Nations people living off reserve and Métis reported having one
or more disabilities in relatively higher proportions compared to all Canadians age 15 and older.
Supporting the FIFA Men’s World Cup 2026
Funding for Department of Canadian Heritage, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Canada Border
Services Agency, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, and
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada for their activities in support of the FIFA Men’s
World Cup 2026.
Federal activities to support Toronto’s and Vancouver’s hosting of the FIFA Men’s World Cup 2026
will benefit residents in these two cities and surrounding areas, as well as domestic and international
visitors.
Funding for the Terry Fox Research Institute
Funding to support the Terry Fox Research Institute’s research into precision oncology treatments.
This measure will directly benefit Canadians living with cancer. Although cancer can and does occur
at all ages, over 90 per cent of cancer diagnoses are in individuals 50 or older. Overall rates of
cancer prevalence are similar across gender, geographic region, and income level.
Top-Up Tax Credit
Introducing a temporary, non-refundable Top-Up Tax Credit for individuals whose non-refundable
credits exceed the first tax bracket and who could owe more tax due to the reduction of the first
personal tax rate and related credit rate.
The measure would benefit a small number of individuals who claim very large non-refundable tax
credits that exceed the top of the first bracket threshold ($57,375 in 2025). The benefiting group is
expected to be relatively gender balanced, with average tax savings increasing with the taxpayer’s
income. Seniors are expected to receive a comparatively higher share of the benefits.

34 ANNEX 6
Extending Employment Insurance Parental Benefits During Bereavement
Funding for Employment and Social Development Canada and amendments to the Employment
Insurance Act to allow claimants receiving Employment Insurance (EI) parental benefits to access up
to eight additional weeks of parental benefits after a child’s death.
This measure would benefit parents who are receiving EI maternity or parental benefits at the time
of the death of their child by providing them with access to up to eight weeks of EI parental benefits
after the child’s death. Women are expected to benefit more than men, as women are more likely to
receive EI maternity and parental benefits, and also receive these benefits for longer. In 2023-24, 69
per cent of new parental benefits claims were by women and 91 per cent of total EI maternity and
parental benefits paid went to women.
Rebuilding, Rearming, and Reinvesting in the Canadian Armed Forces
Funding to the Department of National Defence and other departments to rebuild, rearm, and
reinvest in the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF).
This measure would benefit all Canadians and the citizens of our allied partners by supporting the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) collective defence and helping to preserve the rules-
based international order upon which Canada’s security and economic interests depend. Members
of CAF would indirectly benefit by having the resources and equipment they need to protect
Canadian and allied sovereignty. Data from 2024 indicates that 16.6 per cent of CAF members
identify as women, 9.4 per cent as racialised, and 2.8 per cent as Indigenous. Workers in defence
industries, of whom 27 per cent are women, would also indirectly benefit from the increased access
to capital and bolstered supply chains for these companies.
A New Defence Investment Agency
Funding to Public Services and Procurement Canada to establish the Defence Investment Agency
and to increase capacity and modernise its Industrial Security Program to support the Defence
Investment Agency and Canada’s defence industry.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring Canada’s military is equipped to perform in
operations at home and abroad, which helps to preserve the rules-based international order upon
which Canada’s security and economic interests depend. For members of the Canadian Armed
Forces, who are predominantly White men, procuring defence capabilities will improve working
conditions and help ensure they have the equipment needed to fulfill their duties. Indirectly,
benefits will accrue to workers in the defence and science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics industries, which predominantly employ men.
Operation REASSURANCE
Funding to the Department of National Defence in support of the renewal of Operation
REASSURANCE, to continue the Canadian Armed Forces’ (CAF) largest overseas mission to deter
Russian aggression and defend NATO territory.
This measure would benefit all Canadians and the citizens of our allied partners, especially in Central
and Eastern Europe, by supporting NATO’s collective defence and helping to preserve the rules-
based international order upon which Canada and our allies’ security and economic interests
depend. The populations of Canada and Central and Eastern European countries are largely gender-
balanced. Additionally, members of the CAF would indirectly benefit by having the resources and
equipment they need to perform the operation. Data from 2024 indicates that 16.6 per cent of CAF
members identify as women, 9.4 per cent as racialised, and 2.8 per cent as Indigenous.
-- 478 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 35
Operation AMARNA
Funding to the Department of National Defence in support of the renewal of Operation AMARNA,
to support the Canadian Armed Forces' (CAF) contribution to strengthening peace and security in
the Middle East.
This measure would benefit all Canadians, by strengthening peace and security in the Middle East,
which helps to preserve the rules-based international order upon which Canada and our allies’
security, and economic interests depend. The populations of Canada and Middle East countries are
gender-balanced. Additionally, members of the CAF would indirectly benefit by having the
resources and equipment they need to perform the operation. Data from 2024 indicates that 16.6
per cent of CAF members identify as women, 9.4 per cent as racialised, and 2.8 per cent as
Indigenous.
Strengthening Federal Law Enforcement
Funding to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to strengthen its capacity, and increase the
cadet recruitment allowance.
Strengthening the RCMP is expected to have broad-reaching benefits for all Canadians as it will
enhance the organisation’s ability to respond to a wide range of criminal and security threats
including national security and transnational criminal networks.
Establishing a Financial Crimes Agency
The government will create a new Act, with consequential amendments to other statues, to
establish a Financial Crimes Agency, which would be Canada’s lead enforcement agency against
financial crime.
Combatting financial crime, including fraud and money laundering, benefits all Canadians by
protecting them and the integrity of Canada’s financial system. All Canadians, regardless of age,
gender, or income level, can be potential victims of fraud. Combatting money laundering indirectly
helps to combat linked criminal offences that generate proceeds of crime (such as human trafficking,
drug and weapons smuggling, and fraud). Victims of these linked offences comprise various diverse,
often vulnerable, groups with different characteristics, among these are women, Indigenous people,
black and racialised communities, seniors, and newcomers.
Enhancing the Canada Border Services Agency
Funding to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to bolster its capacity to manage the secure
cross-border flow of goods and travelers, and to uphold the integrity of Canada’s surtax and trade
remedy system.
This measure would broadly benefit all Canadians by making communities safer, as it will strengthen
the CBSA’s ability to detect, examine, and interdict illicit goods at the border. It will also help combat
criminal activities associated with smuggling and the drug trade, related to importing drugs and drug
precursors and exporting domestically manufactured substances. Securing our border will also
benefit Canadians from a stronger international reputation, and the protection of Canadian business
interests from unfair trade practices.
Enhancing the Canada Border Services Agency – Early Retirement Benefits for Frontline
Workers in the Public Service
Proposed legislative amendments to the Public Service Superannuation Act to extend early retirement
benefits to operational members (i.e., frontline workers) of the Public Service Pension Plan.
This measure will directly benefit operational frontline members of the Public Service Pension Plan
(PSPP), by enabling them to retire earlier at an unreduced pension. These beneficiaries are
predominantly men. For example, the Border Services group was 59 per cent men in 2024, while the
Firefighters group in the Core Public Administration was 95 per cent men. This measure will also
indirectly benefit the dependents of these plan members. As at March 31, 2023, contributors to the
PSPP who qualified for operational service had average pensionable earnings of approximately
$120,000, compared to a median market income of $68,700 for Canadian families and unattached
individuals in 2022.

36 ANNEX 6
Modernising the Meteorological Service of Canada
Funding to Environment and Climate Change Canada and Shared Services Canada to procure the
next High-Performance Computing (HPC) solution for the Meteorological Service of Canada and to
modernise HPC operations.
This measure would benefit all Canadians through improved meteorological services. Improved
weather and climate forecasting would disproportionately benefit groups that are more vulnerable
to adverse impacts of extreme weather such as heat, flooding or wildfires. This includes seniors,
young children, pregnant people, persons with disabilities, people with low socio-economic status,
and Indigenous people. Canadians working in weather-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and
transportation would also benefit. The measure would indirectly benefit the information technology
and engineering sectors and its workforce, which predominantly comprises men, with high levels of
education and middle to high income.
Renewing Canada’s National Public Alerting System
Funding to support the implementation of a new National Public Alerting System model to protect
Canadians during emergency events.
This measure would positively benefit all Canadians by alerting people when an emergency (i.e., as
natural disasters or urgent situations such as Amber Alerts) occurs near them and their communities.
Since some groups, including seniors, persons with disabilities, Indigenous people, and low-income
households, are disproportionately vulnerable to disasters, this measure could positively impact
these groups by providing timely and critical information during an emergency so that they may
seek relevant assistance.
Improving Preclearance at Canada’s Borders
Funding to Transport Canada to develop and implement a new preclearance access regime, along
with digital solutions to maximise efficiency in security screening activities.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by supporting a more secure transportation system.
However, there would be particular benefits for employees who require unescorted access to U.S.
preclearance areas within airports and marine facilities to be able to work in these facilities.
Applicants tend to be men (62 per cent) who are lower income (majority earning less than $20 per
hour). Increased efficiency in security screening activities would also benefit the transportation
sector by facilitating the hiring of employees.
Removing Assault-Style Firearms from our Streets
Re-align funding for the continuation of the Assault-Style Firearms Compensation Program in the
most efficient and cost-effective way possible within its existing funding envelope.
This measure would benefit groups most often targeted by violence involving a firearm, including
men who are both the primary perpetrators of firearm-related violence and its main victims. In
2023, 56 per cent of victims of police-reported firearm-related violent crime were men aged 18 and
older. This measure may also benefit youth and young adults who are accused of firearm-related
crime at a higher rate than any other age group. In addition, women, Indigenous people, and Black
and racialised people, who account for a significant portion of victims of firearm-related violence,
could also be positively affected.
Strengthening Canada’s Emergency Management
Funding to Natural Resources Canada to lease four aircraft to bolster provincial and territorial aerial
firefighting capacity
Supporting provincial and territorial aerial firefighting capacity would benefit all Canadians,
particularly those in who live in regions that are at heightened risk of wildfires.
-- 480 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 37
Combatting Financial Fraud
This measure will help combat financial fraud against Canadians by developing a whole-of-
government strategy and enhancing Bank Act consumer protections by requiring banks to have
policies and procedures to address consumer-targeted fraud, allow consumers to adjust certain
account capabilities, and report fraud data to the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada.
This measure would benefit all Canadians, regardless of age, gender, or income level, who can be
potential victims of fraud. According to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, seniors are more likely to
be defrauded through conventional methods, such as direct telephone calls, rather than cyber-
enabled fraud. However, younger age groups are increasingly being victimised by nuanced and age-
specific forms of fraud, such as through the use of digital platforms.
Ensuring Crime Doesn’t Pay
Proposes legislative amendments to: 1) the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist
Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to restrict the acceptance of: cash deposits from one person into the
account of another person; and a cash payment donation or deposit of $10,000 or more; and the
PCMLTFA with related amendments to the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
Act to clarify public to private information sharing provisions to help better detect and deter money
laundering and support the recently created Integrated Money Laundering Intelligence Partnership
between banks and law enforcement.
Combatting financial crime benefits all Canadians by protecting Canadians and the integrity of
Canada’s financial system. Combatting money laundering indirectly helps to combat linked criminal
offences that generate proceeds of crime (such as human trafficking, drug and weapons smuggling,
and fraud). Victims of these linked offences are comprised of various diverse, often vulnerable,
groups with different characteristics, among these are women, Indigenous people, black and
racialised communities, seniors, and newcomers.
Improving Asylum Claim Processing Efficiency
Funding for the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada to support asylum claim processing.
This measure would benefit asylum claimants in Canada through more timely decisions on their
claims. Asylum claimants arriving in Canada are a diverse group. The top source countries for asylum
claimants referred to the Immigration and Refugee Board in the first half of 2025 (January to June)
were India, Haiti, Nigeria, Iran, Mexico, Bangladesh, and China. In 2023-24, 38 per cent of asylum
claimants in Canada identified as women and 61 per cent as men (less than 1 per cent other).
Asylum claimants tend to be lower income, particularly upon arrival in Canada.
NATO's Ukraine Comprehensive Assistance Package
Funding to support the enhancement of Ukraine’s security and defence institutions and deter
Russian aggression, while also enabling interoperability with NATO.
This measure would benefit Ukraine and its population by supporting their security and defence
against Russia’s invasion. This includes benefitting women and children, as they are
disproportionately negatively affected by conflict. By supporting Ukraine’s right to self-
determination, Canadians would indirectly benefit through the bolstering of the rules-based
international system under which Canadians thrive.
Comprehensive Expenditure Review and Optimizing Productivity in Government
The Comprehensive Expenditure Review (CER) of government spending has assessed if programs
are meeting their objectives, are core to the federal mandate and complement, rather than
duplicate, services delivered by other federal departments or other levels of government. Future
reviews will focus on horizontal themes such as consolidation program administration, scaling
artificial intelligence implementation and reviewing business subsidies and skills programming.
All Canadians will benefit from modernizing government, right-sizing programs, improving efficiency,
and delivering better services and results. This measure allows the government to spend more on
generational investments which grow the economy, while also protecting essential programs to
make life more affordable. All CER proposals were developed using Gender-Based Analysis Plus to
assess impacts on diverse Canadians, including vulnerable groups. Statutory transfers payments to
provinces, territories and individuals are outside the scope of the review. Horizontal reviews would
examine programs where changes to make them more efficient and effective could benefit all
Canadians or specific groups.
-- 481 of 493 --

38 ANNEX 6
Reinvestment to Improve Compliance and Debt Collection
Funding for the Canada Revenue Agency to reinvest in high priority areas to improve compliance
and debt collection.
This measure will benefit all Canadians by improving productivity and efficiency of the Canada
Revenue Agency in carrying out its compliance and debt collection activities. Additionally, this
measure will help maintain the integrity of the tax system by reducing the growth in tax debt and
protecting revenues important for sustaining benefits and services for all Canadians.
Workforce Renewal
To manage reductions to the public service from the Comprehensive Expenditure Review to
greatest extent possible through attrition and voluntary departures, this measure proposes to
amend the Public Service Superannuation Act and the Income Tax Regulations to offer a voluntary
Early Retirement Incentive (ERI) program through the Public Service Pension Plan.
All Canadians will benefit from the improved fiscal outlook as a result of the Comprehensive
Expenditure Review. The ERI program is targeted at public servants who are 50 years of age or
older who will be able to retire early with an unreduced pension in accordance and subject to the
parameters of the program. The public service is 56.8 per cent women, but as the program is
voluntary, it is unknown what the demographic profile of participants would be. All else equal, the
pension waiver under the program could be more valuable to women, as they have a higher life
expectancy than men at age 50 (33.9 years compared to 29.1 years).
Equitable Public Sector Retirement Benefits – Pension Modernization
The government will initiate consultations with key stakeholders for the federal government
pension plans to align the plans with the Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan
enhancements.
All Canadians will benefit from the government’s stronger financial position as a result of this
adjustment. Some federal employees who prefer to have higher net pay would benefit from the
measure. Employees who would prefer to defer their current income in exchange for higher pension
payments could arguably be negatively impacted. Women represent approximately 57 per cent of
contributors to the Public Service Pension Plan, 17 per cent of contributors to the Canadian Armed
Forces Pension Plan and 19 per cent of contributors to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Pension
Plan.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Negative impacts on employees who may wish to save more for
retirement would be mitigated as those individuals will be able to direct their increased take-home
pay towards their Registered Retirement Savings Plan, as they will have increased contribution room
as a result of the proposed changes.
Equitable Public Sector Retirement Benefits – Pensioners’ Dental Services Plan
The government will consult stakeholders on changing the Pensioners’ Dental Services Plan so that,
going forward, the years of service required to be eligible for the Plan in retirement would increase
from two to six years.
All Canadians will benefit from the improved fiscal outlook stemming from the savings that will be
delivered this measure. Public servants retiring with less than six years of service and their
dependents could be negatively impacted, as they may no longer be eligible for post-retirement
dental benefits. There are no anticipated negative impacts for existing members of the Pensioners’
Dental Services Plan or public servants who retire with less than six years of service due to disability
and receive benefits through the Public Service Pension Plan.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Public servants who retire with less than six years of service due to
disability and receive benefits through the Public Service Pension Plan would still be eligible for
coverage. For others, who do not retire with the requisite amount of service, they may be eligible
for similar coverage under the Canadian Dental Care Plan.

IMPACTS REPORT 39
Collective Bargaining in Good Faith
Budget 2025 proposes to introduce amendments to the Federal Public Sector Labour Relations Act to
ensure the government can attract and retain the necessary public service talent, while respecting
the Government of Canada’s fiscal circumstances relative to its stated budgetary policies and
objectives.
Federal public servants will continue to benefit from a labour relations regime that respects
collective bargaining in good faith. They will further benefit from a greater certainty and
transparency on the factors an arbitration boards would take into account when making an arbitral
award. All Canadians will benefit from a public service labour relations arbitration framework which
gives a preponderance towards attracting and retaining talent to meet the needs of Canadians,
while also considering Canada’s fiscal position.
Improving the Integrity of Student Financial Assistance
Proposes legislative and regulatory amendments to address program integrity issues and promote
fairness and efficiency.
This measure would benefit youth aged 18 to 24 as it would direct students to public institutions
that tend to result in better educational outcomes. Women are expected to benefit more as they
comprise a higher portion of student aid recipients (60 per cent in 2022-23). It would also benefit all
Canadians by contributing to the financial sustainability of student aid and enabling more efficient
utilisation of public funds.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: As this measure limits student aid flowing to attendees of private
institutions, it is possible that some students would be negatively impacted. It is expected, however,
that implementation of this measure will direct students to alternate public institutions that tend to
have better educational outcomes. Employment and Social Development Canada would also
maintain the authority to consider exemptions and include specific private educational institutions
on a case-by-case basis to ensure that negative impacts on students and their communities can be
mitigated.
Faster Services for Veterans
Funding to Veterans Affairs Canada to stabilise its temporary disability benefits workforce and to
modernise disability benefits operational processes and Information Technology infrastructure.
This measure will benefit CAF members and veterans who have been diagnosed with a medical
condition or disability related to their military service, such as a physical injury, chronic illness, or
mental health disorder, by ensuing they receive timely decisions on their disability benefit
applications and faster access to financial support and associated services. As CAF members are
predominantly men, this group is expected to benefit more than women. This measure will also
indirectly benefit the families and caretakers of veterans and military members by improving the
quality of VAC’s services and making it easier to access eligible benefits and supports.
Investment Income Derived from Assets Supporting Canadian Insurance Risks
Clarifying that income derived from assets held by a foreign affiliate of a Canadian insurance
company that support Canadian insurance risks is taxable in Canada.
This tax integrity measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring a fair and efficient tax system
and by protecting the tax base.
Tax Deferral Through Tiered Corporate Structures
Preventing the deferral of income tax payable by private corporations on investment income by
interposing corporations with staggered year-ends.
This tax integrity measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring a fair and efficient tax system
and by protecting the tax base.
-- 483 of 493 --

40 ANNEX 6
Reforming and Modernising Canada’s Transfer Pricing Rules
Implementing modifications to the existing transfer pricing rules to better align the domestic rules
with the international consensus reflected in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development Transfer Pricing Guidelines.
As a tax integrity measure, this proposal is expected to benefit all Canadians by protecting the tax
base. This measure is expected to improve tax fairness and equality by ensuring multinational
enterprises do not artificially shift their profits outside of Canada.
Combatting Carousel Fraud
Proposed reverse charge mechanism to address carousel fraud under the Goods and Services
Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax, beginning with certain supplies in the telecommunications sector.
This is a tax integrity measure aimed at preventing carousel fraud and improving the fairness and
efficiency of the tax system. This measure will benefit all Canadians by helping to protect Canada’s
revenue base, which supports programs and benefits that improve the quality of life for all
Canadians.
Luxury Tax on Aircraft and Vessels
Eliminating the subject aircraft and subject vessel components of the luxury tax base.
This measure would provide relief to the aviation and boating industries and increase the overall
efficiency of the luxury tax framework. It would provide tax relief to individuals who would
otherwise pay the luxury tax on the purchase or lease of subject aircraft and subject vessels, who
are disproportionately higher income and primarily men. It would also support employment if it
leads to an increase in sales.
Eliminating the Underused Housing Tax
Eliminating the Underused Housing Tax (UHT) beginning with the 2025 calendar year to reduce
compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for government.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by making the tax system more efficient. It would also
benefit residential property owners that are currently required to pay the UHT and/or file an annual
UHT return, which is a group that is roughly gender-balanced, with a higher median household and
individual income compared to the general population. This group likely includes a high percentage
of non-resident, non-Canadians.
Administrative Funding for the Clean Economy Tax Credits
Funding for the Canada Revenue Agency to administer the Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits.
This measure would benefit Canadian businesses by addressing the backlog for processing claims
associated with these tax credits. These are particularly beneficial for companies in the utilities,
manufacturing, processing, engineering, oil and gas and construction sectors, particularly if they are
located in Western Canada. Shareholders and employees of these companies are disproportionately
older men and high-income earners. Advancing efforts on net-zero transition will benefit all
Canadians, especially youth and future generations, by reducing negative climate impacts.
Administrative Funding for Tax Fairness for Global Corporations
Funding for the Canada Revenue Agency to ensure integrity and to deliver on the commitments
related to tax fairness for global corporations, specifically 1) Global Minimum Tax, 2) Excessive
Interest and Financing Expense Limitation rules and 3) Mandatory Disclosure Rules.
This tax integrity measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring large global and digital
corporations pay their fair share of taxes.
-- 484 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 41
Funding Advertising for Communicating to Canadians
Funding for the Privy Council Office to increase the annual limit of the Central Advertising Fund,
supporting the effective communication of government policy.
This measure benefits all Canadians by ensuring they receive clear and timely information about
their rights and responsibilities, the programs and services that affect them, and any potential risks
to health, safety, and the environment, enabling informed decisions and easier access to support.
This measure will also indirectly benefit the advertising industry in Canada. According to Statistics
Canada data on occupation unit groups by gender, advertising, marketing and public relations
managers and professionals have higher proportions of women than men.
Real-time Employer Reported Payroll Pilot
Funding for Employment and Social Development Canada to launch a pilot project to assess
whether Employment Insurance (EI) eligibility and entitlement can be determined accurately and
securely using real-time payroll information.
While this measure is a pilot, it is expected to influence future decisions that would primarily benefit
Canadian workers (i.e., Canadians with employment income), EI benefit applicants and recipients,
and businesses of all sizes by reducing the reporting burden, improving program and service
delivery, and streamlining employers’ and employees’ interactions with the federal government.
Advancing a Common Government of Canada Desktop Solution
Funding for Shared Services Canada (SSC) to advance the proof-of-concept phase for a common
government-wide desktop solution and to explore transitioning government departments to a
standardised, cloud-managed desktop service.
This measure would benefit federal public service workers in pilot departments through reduced
complexity of desktop systems, standardised information technology security, and increased
portability of devices. Notably, the federal public service is roughly gender balanced, with 56.8 per
cent of employees and 54.5 per cent of executives identifying as women as of March 31, 2024.
There may be indirect positive impacts for federal public servants with disabilities, as new
information technology solutions tend to have more accessibility features and interoperability.
Continuing Collection of Emergency Benefits Overpayments
Funding for Employment and Social Development Canada to support collection of overpayments
related to the COVID-19 emergency benefits, in collaboration with the Canada Revenue Agency.
Post-payment verifications concluded on March 31, 2025, but collection of overpayments will
continue until March 31, 2028.
This measure will benefit all Canadians by recovering overpayments from those who were not the
intended beneficiaries of the emergency benefits and contribute to more efficient utilisation of
public funds.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Collection of overpayments could impose burden on low-income
Canadians. That said, to minimise negative impacts for Canadians, this measure focuses on clients
who have the highest likelihood of repayment. Where possible, Employment and Social
Development Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency will negotiate flexible repayment terms with
clients, based on their ability to pay.
Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Human Resources Information Technology System
Modernisation
Funding to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) in support of the modernisation of its
human resources information technology system.
This measure will reduce time lost to paper-based tracking, strengthening organisational efficiency
and productivity. A more efficient CNSC will be able to review nuclear projects more rapidly, costing
less overall to both taxpayers and licensees, which tend to be utilities that ultimately pass on costs
to consumers. It will also enable these projects to get off the ground more rapidly to provide much
needed power earlier. It will therefore benefit all Canadians.
-- 485 of 493 --

42 ANNEX 6
Home Accessibility Tax Credit
Modifying the Home Accessibility Tax Credit to no longer allow an expense to be claimed under this
credit if it has been claimed under the Medical Expense Tax Credit.
While all Canadians would benefit from reduced debt or more effective government spending, those
who may have claimed the same expenses under the Home Accessibility Tax Credit and under the
Medical Expense Tax Credit could be negatively affected. Claimants of the Home Accessibility Tax
Credit disproportionately include those aged 65+, those who claim the Disability Tax Credit, and
those with relatively high family incomes.
Agricultural Cooperatives: Patronage Dividends Paid in Shares
Extending the period during which agricultural cooperatives can distribute tax-deferred patronage
dividends paid in shares to their members until the end of 2030.
This measure would benefit members of agricultural cooperatives. It would be fairly gender
balanced. Most beneficiaries live in the province of Québec and have taxable income of less than
$50,000 per year.
Building High-Speed Rail Faster
Proposes legislative amendments to streamline approval processes and reduce regulatory
uncertainties for the Alto High-Speed Rail project.
This measure is not expected to have significant direct impacts on particular groups. Indigenous
communities and other underrepresented groups are being engaged to inform the design of the Alto
high-speed rail project and develop their capacity and readiness to economically participate in the
project’s its design and construction. A completed project would directly benefit travellers in the
Québec City to Toronto corridor through the provision of faster and more reliable passenger rail
service. These travellers are more likely to be students, highly educated, and middle-income
households.
Renewing the Sunset Provision of the Financial Institutions Statutes
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, the Insurance Companies Act, and the Trust and
Loan Companies Act to renew the sunset provision for 7 years to June 30, 2033.
All Canadians will benefit from this measure, as it will permit federally regulated financial institutions
to carry on business in Canada beyond June 30, 2026. Furthermore, the sunset provision drives the
timing of the regular review of the statutes, which ensures that the statutes remain up to date,
technically sounds and responsive to emerging trends in the financial sector.
Modernising Canada's Biosecurity Oversight Framework
Proposes legislative amendments to help the Public Health Agency of Canada to modernise
Canada’s biosecurity oversight framework through the Human Pathogens and Toxins Act.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by helping to address biosecurity risks and helping to
prevent the release of pathogens that could have a negative impact on the health of Canadians.
Those at higher risk for adverse outcomes related to existing and emerging public health
emergencies, such as people with pre-existing health conditions, children, and older adults, may
benefit more. An additional benefit of strengthening biosecurity at biocontainment facilities is the
protection it affords to Canada’s research and development investments, national interests, and
international reputation, all of which could be affected by a deliberate pathogen release.
Strengthening the Financial Sector Transaction Approval Process to Include Additional
Considerations
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to enable additional considerations in financial sector transaction approval processes.
This measure will benefit all Canadians, by fostering the sound administration of federal laws that
support a safe and secure financial sector.
-- 486 of 493 --

IMPACTS REPORT 43
Modernising Limits on Borrowing and Portfolio Investments
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to repeal limits on borrowing and portfolio investments in commercial loans, real
estate and equity, as applicable, and replace them with more flexible guidance from The Office of
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
This measure will benefit all Canadians from the government being able to respond more quickly to
emerging risks in the financial sector.
Electronic Delivery of Governance Documents in the Financial Institutions Statutes
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to include a “notice-and-access” method of delivery of governance documents, while
retaining owners’ right to request delivery by mail.
This measure will benefit all Canadians by allowing federally regulated financial institutions to more
efficiently communicate with their owners (for example, shareholders). Allowing for increased use of
electronic communications reduces the environmental impact of generating and circulating paper
documents.
Bearer Instruments in the Financial Institutions Statutes
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to prohibit federally regulated financial institutions from issuing documents that
evidence conversion privileges, options, or rights to acquire a share in bearer form.
Anonymous ownership of bearer instruments can facilitate money laundering and terrorist financing.
All Canadians will benefit from safeguarding the integrity of federally regulated financial institutions
and a safe and secure financial sector.
Supporting Canadians During Branch Closures
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act to mitigate impacts of branch closures by lowering
switching costs for consumers looking to move accounts to other institutions following closure of
their branch, by providing notice of upcoming closures on bank websites, and by clarifying
requirements for online account opening.
This measure will benefit Canadians in rural and remote areas who lack geographically convenient
access to in-person financial services. This amendment will help ensure that such groups have clear
processes for opening bank accounts remotely and are protected from unfair barriers when
changing banking services after the closure of a local branch.
Enhancing the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions’ Authorities to
Protect the Financial Sector Against Integrity and Security Risks
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to enhance the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institution’s (OSFI)
authorities to address integrity and security risks. It will also introduce changes to the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act to bolster the Superintendent’s ability to receive and share
information with federal government agencies and bodies.
These changes are intended to positively affect Canadians as a whole by improving the protection
of the financial sector from integrity and security threats. Strengthening OSFI’s ability to share
information related to its mandate would benefit all Canadians by better positioning Canada to
protect the integrity of its financial system and maintain Canadians’ confidence in their financial
institutions.
Protect Against the Disclosure of Sensitive Information Collected and Produced Under
the Retail Payment Activities Act
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Access to Information Act to protect against the disclosure
of confidential information collected and produced under the Retail Payment Activities Act.
These changes are intended to benefit all Canadians by protecting confidential information related
to the supervision of payment service providers. This will help promote compliance with the Retail
Payment Activities Act, which contributes to a safe and secure retail payment sector.

44 ANNEX 6
Protect the Minister of Finance and Government Officials Against Risks of Civil Liability
Proposes legislative amendments to the Bank Act, Insurance Companies Act, and Trust and Loan
Companies Act to provide that the Minister of Finance and government officials are protected
against civil liability in the good faith performance or omission of actions under those Acts.
This measure benefits all Canadians by fostering the sound administration of federal laws that
support a safe and secure financial sector.
Targeted Windfall Profit Charge
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Special Economic Measures Act.
The targeted windfall profit charge will benefit all Canadians by enabling profits from sanctioned
property to serve public policy objectives.
Mitigating Potential Financial Sector Risks From Sanctions
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Special Economic Measures Act to provide that the Minister
of Finance must be consulted before an order or regulation identifying certain persons is made
under subsection 4(1) of that Act.
Mitigating potential financial sector risks from sanctions will benefit all Canadians by protecting the
integrity of the financial sector.
Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Technical Amendments
Proposes legislative amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
Act, Access to Information Act, and Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
Regulations to make technical amendments to enhance clarity and realise efficiencies.
Combatting financial crime benefits all Canadians by protecting Canadians and the integrity of
Canada’s financial system. This measure also indirectly helps to combat linked criminal offences that
generate proceeds of crime (such as human trafficking, drug and weapons smuggling, and fraud).
Victims of these linked offences comprise various diverse, often vulnerable, groups with different
characteristics, among these are women, Indigenous people, black and racialised communities,
seniors, and newcomers.
Strengthening Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Supervision,
Compliance, and Enforcement
Proposes legislative amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
Act (PCMLTFA) and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Administrative
Monetary Penalty Regulations to strengthen AML/ATF supervision, compliance, enforcement, and
information sharing, including by better identifying the businesses and professionals with AML/ATF
obligations, increasing penalties, and introducing a new compliance agreement framework.
Combatting financial crime benefits all Canadians by protecting Canadians and the integrity of
Canada’s financial system. This measure also indirectly helps to combat linked criminal offences that
generate proceeds of crime (such as human trafficking, drug and weapons smuggling, and fraud).
Victims of these linked offences comprise various diverse, often vulnerable, groups with different
characteristics, among these are women, Indigenous people, black and racialised communities,
seniors, and newcomers.
Review of the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee Membership
Proposes legislative amendments to the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act and
the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) to make the
Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) a member of the Financial
Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC) and enable FINTRAC and current FISC members to
exchange regulatory and supervisory information relevant to the mandate and objective of FISC.
Enhancing information sharing and coordination among federal agencies with financial sector
responsibilities supports high standards of regulatory compliance by federally regulated financial
institutions benefitting all Canadians.

IMPACTS REPORT 45
Support for Homeownership and Multi-Unit Rental Housing Construction
Proposes a legislative amendment to the National Housing Act to increase the guarantees-in-force
limit to $1 trillion and to decouple this limit from the insurance-in-force limit. It would also introduce
legislative amendments to the Protection of Residential Mortgage or Hypothecary Insurance Act to
increase the protected limit for mortgage or hypothecary loans insured under that Act to $500
billion.
No differential impacts as all Canadians will benefit from improvements to the financial sector
framework.
Increasing the Amount of the Borrowing Authority Act
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Borrowing Authority Act limit to support the Government of
Canada’s initiatives to Support Building a New Canadian economy and Defending Canada.
All Canadians will benefit from prudent and responsible management of the government’s
borrowing program.
Legislative Amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act to allow the government to
restrict the importation or exportation of items in response to actions of another country that harm
Canada or to create more secure and reliable supply chains.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by providing additional tools for the government to help
protect Canada’s economic security.
Obsolete or Surplus Goods – Pilot for Donated Goods
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Customs Tariff to allow for duty drawback for certain goods
when they are donated to a registered charity under the Income Tax Act, provided they are to be
used in the organisation’s charitable programs and not re-sold in Canada.
This measure is primarily expected to benefit frontline charities and low-income people who use
charitable services to meet their essential needs, including clothing. This group includes low-income
women and men, as well as those who are unable to work due to mental or physical illness, work
multiple part-time jobs, or are currently searching for work.
Enable Lending to Indigenous Special Purpose Vehicles
Proposes the government’s intention to make legislative amendments to the First Nations Fiscal
Management Act (FNFMA) that will enable the First Nations Finance Authority to lend to Indigenous
special purpose vehicles, which is expected to expand options for affordable financing and better
support Indigenous equity participation in major economic projects.
These amendments would benefit First Nations not yet scheduled to the FNFMA, as well as Inuit
and Métis with a modern treaty or self-government agreement with Canada. Economic and resource
development projects disproportionately affect fields dominated by men (e.g., construction, trades,
engineering) but additional employment opportunities may become available for women in related
service sectors (e.g., administration, accommodation). Employment opportunities are likely to
benefit people across the income spectrum and thereby directly improve economic outcomes
(income, wealth generation, poverty reduction) and indirectly improve social outcomes (housing and
food security, education, health and well-being) in Indigenous communities at large.
Legislative Amendments to the Naskapi and the Cree-Naskapi Commission Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Naskapi and the Cree-Naskapi Commission Act to clarify
Naskapi Police authority on Naskapi lands and eliminate inconsistencies with the Northeastern
Quebec Agreement.
This measure would directly benefit members of Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach and
positively impact the Naskapi-Crown relationship by reducing the potential for conflicting
interpretations of Naskapi Police’s authority on Naskapi lands. Clarifying the authority of Naskapi
Police would further benefit members of the Naskapi Nation, by supporting the provision of
culturally appropriate policing services. Setting clear parameters for policing service delivery is
expected to increase feelings of legitimacy for Indigenous peace officers and overall safety within
the community.

46 ANNEX 6
Legislative Amendments to the Department of Employment and Social Development Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Department of Employment and Social Development Act to
enable the delivery of more integrated and efficient services across government.
These amendments would benefit all Canadians by enabling the development of more efficient and
convenient government services. Modernising legislative authorities to support information sharing
and digital services would particularly benefit groups facing barriers due to outdated, paper-based
processes, particularly seniors, newcomers, persons with disabilities and rural residents. Lower-
income people may also benefit, as these amendments would make it easier to access income
support programs and benefits. These amendments would also benefit Canadians by reducing the
burden of repeatedly providing personal information across government services.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Digital literacy gaps among seniors, connectivity issues in rural and
remote areas, and language barriers for newcomers can create obstacles to navigating digital
platforms and accessing online government services. Additionally, persons with disabilities who
require in-person support may face exclusion if digital services become the dominant method of
service delivery. Maintaining in-person and phone-based service options would help ensure
accessibility for those unable or unwilling to use digital platforms.
Legislative Amendments to the Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada Act and
to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Administrative Tribunals Support Service of Canada Act,
Canadian Environmental Protection Act, and others to enable the provision of more efficient tribunal
support services to the Environmental Protection Tribunal of Canada and to territorial bodies.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by providing administrative support to territorial bodies,
such as labour tribunals. The measure may also disproportionately benefit Indigenous people given
that they represent a larger share of the population in the territories relative to other regions in
Canada. For example, the Yukon population is 22 per cent Indigenous, compared to the national
average of 5 per cent.
Legislative Amendments to the Judges Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Judges Act to allocate judicial resources to Ontario through
8 Unified Family Courts (UFCs) positions and 2 Ontario Court of Appeal positions.
This measure is intended to directly benefit people and families who are involved with the family
justice system, particularly women since UFCs help improve access to justice in family matters,
including conflict involving gender-based violence. Low- or middle-income families who are
unrepresented and family members who face language and cultural barriers would also benefit from
UFCs, as they help increase accessibility to justice resources for these groups. Additionally, this
measure would help promote a fair justice system as judges would be selected through a federal
appointment process that seeks to promote gender balance and diversity.
Legislative Amendments to the Government Annuities Improvement Act
Proposes a legislative amendment to the Government Annuities Improvement Act to eliminate the
legislative requirement for a duplicative audit of the Government Annuities Account.
This measure will modestly benefit all Canadians through the elimination of duplicative audit
requirements for the Government Annuities Account. Canadians and annuitants will continue to
have access to the same information through the Public Accounts, or the actuarial reports published
by the Chief Actuary.
Legislative Amendments to the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act to extend the legislative
review cycle from two to five years.
The amendments would benefit all Canadians by allowing Health Canada more time to consult
broadly and consider more complex aspects of the legislation. Extending the review cycle would also
provide more time to engage Indigenous communities, which have historically had lower
participation rates in regulatory processes. Individuals who smoke and vape would also benefit from
the amendments, with particular benefits for lower-income Canadians, who smoke at higher rates
than the general population.

IMPACTS REPORT 47
Legislative Amendments to the Aeronautics Act and Canada Transportation Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Aeronautics Act to improve Canada’s aviation safety and
security regime, and to the Canada Transportation Act to ensure regulatory alignment with
international standards.
This measure would benefit all Canadians through improvements in the safety and efficiency of the
transportation system. It is expected to have a disproportionate positive benefit for the
transportation sector. Specifically, amendments to the Aeronautics Act would directly benefit air
travelers, who are mostly middle- to high-income earners, and the Canadian air transportation
sector more broadly, in which men comprise 61 per cent of the workforce.
Canada Development Investment Corporation Enabling Legislation
Proposes enabling legislation for the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV) to set
out the corporation’s current mandate in statute and provide greater transparency about the
corporation and its activities.
Enabling legislation for CDEV is expected to benefit all Canadians by providing greater clarity and
transparency concerning the corporation and its activities. It would further support CDEV in the
fulfillment of its commercial mandate.
Enabling Divestiture of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation
Proposes legislative amendments to the Freshwater Fish Marketing Act to enable the advancement of
the divestiture of the Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation (FFMC).
This measure would support the eventual divestiture of the FFMC should an acceptable bid be
identified. As fish harvesters from rural, northern, and predominantly Indigenous communities
receive approximately 80 per cent of the returns from FFMC operations, they may be
disproportionately impacted from an eventual divestiture. A divestiture may also benefit Canadian
taxpayers by eliminating future financial liabilities to the Crown, consistent with prudent financial
stewardship, while transitioning the entity to an ownership and governance model that can remain
competitive in today’s open market.
GBA Plus Responsive Approach: Fish harvesters from remote, northern, and predominantly Indigenous
communities may face risks as a result of the divestiture due to a potential reduction or elimination of
transport, processing and marketing services to their communities. To mitigate these risks, the
divestiture process includes evaluation criteria that promote economic reconciliation and the
maintenance of services to rural and remote communities. Additionally, Indigenous organisations, which
have historically faced barriers to accessing capital, have been provided the opportunity to access
capacity funding to facilitate their participation in the competitive bidding process.
Legislative Amendments to the Canadian Energy Regulator Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Canadian Energy Regulator Act to enable longer licensing
timeframes for liquid natural gas exports.
These amendments may benefit workers in the energy and construction sectors in British Columbia,
as longer licensing timeframes for liquid natural gas (LNG) projects could lead to further economic
activity, including job opportunities. Workers who are men would predominantly benefit, as data
from the British Columbia Construction Association shows women made up less than 5 per cent of
the construction workforce in British Columbia in 2023. Permanent jobs created by LNG projects
are also expected to mostly benefit men, as women represented 24.7 per cent of the workforce in
the Canadian energy sector in 2023, according to the Canadian Centre for Energy Information.
Legislative Amendments to the Red Tape Reduction Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Red Tape Reduction Act to provide all federal ministers with
the authority to enable regulatory sandboxes through issuing temporary and limited exemptions
from legislative or regulatory requirements to allow for testing of products, services, processes, or
new regulatory approaches.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by allowing for modernised regulations that could better
improve health, safety, and the environment for all. The measure could also result in indirect
benefits of improved productivity, innovation, and economic growth outcomes for Canadians.

48 ANNEX 6
Legislative Amendments to the Farm Credit Canada Act
Proposes legislative amendments to the Farm Credit Canada Act to require regular legislative reviews
to ensure alignment with the needs of the agriculture and agri-food sector.
This measure would benefit owners of farms and businesses in the agriculture and agri-food sectors
by ensuring Farm Credit Canada’s activities are responsive to the changing needs of the sector.
Farm operators are predominately older White men, and farm families tend to have higher average
incomes compared to all Canadians. Traditionally underrepresented groups such as women, youth,
Indigenous, 2SLGBTQI+, and Black and racialised entrepreneurs may particularly benefit from
regular legislative reviews to better enable Farm Credit Canada to align its activities with their
specific needs.
Penalising Predatory Debt Advisors
Proposes a legislative amendment to expand the enforcement powers of the Office of the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy by adding a civil fine and restitution for non-compliance with
offences detailed in subsection 202(1) of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, and to increase the
maximum criminal fine for non-compliance with that Act from $5,000 to $100,000 for individuals,
and $1 million for corporations.
This measure benefits all Canadians as the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is a law of general
application but may benefit financially vulnerable groups more. A 2020 survey by the Financial
Consumer Agency of Canada found that women (58 per cent), especially older women, low-income
households (73 per cent), Indigenous people (74 per cent), and newcomers (66 per cent) reported
higher financial vulnerability, with lower levels of financial literacy being a compounding factor.
Legislative Amendments to the Territorial Lands Act
Proposes to introduce amendments to the Territorial Lands Act to protect and advance the national
interests of Canada and the interests of Inuit in Nunavut.
The amendments would benefit Inuit and other Northerners in Nunavut by supporting resource
development initiatives that advance local and national interests. The measure is expected to
benefit people across income and age spectrums, but men are expected to benefit
disproportionately given that they are overrepresented in the workforce of resource extraction
industries.
Amendments to the Broadcasting Act
Proposes to introduce amendments to the Broadcasting Act to restore the right to privacy of
individuals to the interpretation provisions and remove a duplicative provision relating to official
languages.
All Canadians will benefit from this measure, but no disproportionate impacts are expected for any
particular group.
Legislative Amendments to the Canada Post Corporation Act
Proposes amendments to the Canada Post Corporation Act to modernise and expedite the stamp
rate-setting process by allowing Canada Post Corporation to set postage rates.
This measure is expected to benefit all Canadians by helping improve the future financial
sustainability of Canada Post operations. Canadians across all regions of the country, including in
remote and underserved communities, who rely on the delivery of lettermail by Canada Post, will be
positively impacted.
Faster dissolution of federal corporations listed as terrorist entities
Proposes amendments to the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Canada Not-for-profit
Corporations Act, and the Canada Cooperatives Act to allow for quicker dissolution of a federal
corporation when it is listed as a terrorist entity under the Criminal Code.
This measure would benefit all Canadians by strengthening federal anti-terrorism tools and by
helping to maintain public trust in our institutions, including the federal corporate registry.

IMPACTS REPORT 49
Qualified Investments for Registered Plans
Proposes to simplify and harmonise the qualified investment rules that apply to certain registered
plans (e.g., Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)). In
particular, this measure would streamline the rules relating to small business investments and
replace the registered investment regime with new categories of qualified investments as of 2027.
This measure would benefit the millions of Canadians who have contributed to certain registered
plans. For instance, according to the 2021 census, 34 per cent of Canadian households contributed
to RRSPs and 45 per cent to TFSAs. Moreover, roughly half of all contributors to RRSPs and TFSAs
are women, though women tend to make smaller contributions on average. Additionally, higher-
income households are more likely to contribute to these plans. Certain registered plans also benefit
targeted groups such as persons with disabilities, parents, students, and first-time home buyers.
21-Year Rule
Proposes to broaden an anti-avoidance rule in the Income Tax Act that prevents direct trust-to-trust
property transfers from being used to defer income tax on accrued property gains beyond 21 years
to include indirect transfers of trust property to other trusts.
This tax integrity measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring a fair and efficient tax system
and by protecting the tax base.
Treatment of Manual Osteopathic Services
Proposes to remove the duplicative and outdated relieving provisions for osteopathic services in the
Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax legislation.
This tax integrity measure would benefit all Canadians by ensuring a fair and efficient tax system
and by protecting the tax base.
